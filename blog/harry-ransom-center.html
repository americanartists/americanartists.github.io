      <h1>The Harry Ransom Center For The Humanities</h1>
      <h3>by Steven Smith</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>
      The building in which the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center is
      housed on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin has been
      described as everything from a "windowless box" to a "cold
      storage unit". The architecture is without doubt the unfortunate
      offspring of gray Texas limestone and late International Style.</p><p>Nonetheless, for anyone who ventures inside, the cultural
      riches to be found, particularly in literary collections and archival
      materials from the 19th and 20th centuries, rival those of any humanities
      institution in the western world.</p><p>Once one delves past the gratifying eye-candy at the HRC--a copy of the Gutenberg Bible, the world’s first photograph (taken in France in 1826), the set of authentic Scarlett O’Hara dresses worn by Vivien Leigh in <i>Gone With The Wind</i>--a certain logic to the holdings becomes apparent. Despite the fine Pforzheimer Library containing a first edition of Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i> and a Shakespeare <i>First Folio</i>, notwithstanding the excellent collection of Alexander Pope, Voltaire and  illustrated William Blake volumes that grace the shelves, the inevitable conclusion that every visitor makes is that this place is about <i>the  twentieth century</i>, with the nineteenth century in a strong supporting
      role. What is so remarkable is the sheer breadth and depth of the HRC’s literary and artistic collections chronicling this rapidly closing century.</p><p>When UT Austin Vice President and Provost Harry Ransom first founded the Center in 1957, he had the advantage of a bit of naivete and a half-dozen very
      wealthy benefactors interested in bringing culture to the heart of Texas. Anyone who’s ever seen the movie <i>Giant</i> may get a feel for what those heady days in Texas were like--awash in oil
      money and optimism, families too "big rich" to care about being uncouth (and what’s changed, you ask? perhaps only the oil business).</p><p>

      UT Austin Vice President and Provost Harry Ransom first founded the Center
      in 1957, he had the advantage of a bit of naivete and a half-dozen very
      wealthy benefactors interested in bringing culture to the heart of Texas.
      Anyone who’s ever seen the movie <i>Giant</i>
      may get a feel for what those heady days in Texas were like--awash in oil
      money and optimism, families too "big rich" to care about being
      uncouth (and what’s changed, you ask? perhaps only the oil business).</p><p>The particular stroke of genius which Harry Ransom applied
      to the Center’s founding had to do with its acquisitions policies.
      Rather than becoming yet another gullible American overbidding on precious
      centuries-old books and manuscripts at European auction houses (and thus
      putting the Center into an eternally no-win situation of catch-up with the
      rest of the world’s great libraries), Ransom decided to focus on
      late-19th and 20th-century manuscripts, specifically British and American,
      the prices of which had hit rock bottom in the late 1950’s and early
      1960’s. More than collecting, Ransom was speculating in an untested
      market.</p><p>Furthermore,
      Ransom didn’t merely aim for 20th-century manuscripts and rare books, he
      wanted the letters, diaries, notebooks, post cards and other written
      materials of the great authors--but who <i>were</i>
      the great authors? And who could judge? The century was not six decades
      old.</p><p>Thus,
      Ransom was engaged in a triply dangerous game: he purchased personal
      papers as well as literary works (a questionable practice at the time), he
      bought the archives of still-living or recently dead authors (whose status
      was tenuous in the literary canon), and he risked the wrath of his primary
      donors, many of whom still believed in the William Randolph Hearst school
      of cultural acquisition.</p><p>The
      one argument Ransom had going for him, and which in the end won over a
      majority of his monied supporters, was that Texas could be a truly
      world-class center for the study of 19th and 20th century British and
      American literary archives, perhaps on balance even <i>the
      best</i> spot on the planet for it. This proved too attractive a
      proposition to turn down for many early donors, as well as for the UT
      Regents who funded many of the purchases, and the Ransom Center’s course
      for the coming decades was set.</p><p>In
      1958, Ransom purchased the T.E. Hanley Collection, with large quantities
      of manuscripts and correspondence from George Bernard Shaw, Samuel
      Beckett, D.H. Lawrence, T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, William Butler Yeats and
      Dylan Thomas. This single purchase put Texas instantly on the map, but
      there were more and even greater victories to come: a first edition of
      Eliot’s <i>The Waste Land</i>
      inscribed to Ezra Pound, first editions and corrected proofs of Joyce’s <i>Ulysses, </i>substantial collections and archives of Arthur Miller,
      James Agee, John Steinbeck, Edith Sitwell, Tennessee Williams, much of
      William Faulkner, Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, E.M. Forster, Jean Cocteau
      (in the Carlton Lake French Collection), the personal libraries of Ezra
      Pound, Wyndham Lewis, James Joyce and others. In short, throughout
      Ransom’s tenure as Director of the Center until his death in 1976, a
      steady strategy of 19th and 20th century acquisition was
      pursued--including the famous Gernsheim Collection of Photography that
      features numerous works by Julia Margaret Cameron, Walker Evans and Alvin
      Langdon Coburn.</p><p>As the Ransom Center moved from the 1980’s into the
      1990’s, under the guidance of Thomas F. Staley, new collections were
      added and archives were made more available to scholars through a fully
      endowed fellowship program.</p><p>More
      recent additions (within the last twenty years) to the HRC’s collections
      include the complete archive of Hollywood legend David O. Selznick, the
      complete archive of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., archives of Carson McCullers,
      Adrienne Kennedy, Anne Sexton, Tom Stoppard, David Hare, Isaac Bashevis
      Singer, Leon Uris, Bernard Malamud, John Fowles, Anita Desai, Amos Tutuola,
      Lillian Hellmann, drafts for Ernest Hemingway’s <i>Death
      in the Afternoon</i> and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro", artwork by
      Diego Rivera and Frieda Kahlo, the Norman Bel Geddes collection of
      theatrical design, the photography of Ansel Adams, Edward Steichen and,
      most recently, the complete archive of David Douglas Duncan,
      world-renowned photojournalist and war correspondent from the South
      Pacific in WWII to the Yalu River, Korea, to Khe Sanh in Vietnam. Dozens
      and dozens of further archives run the gamut from Borges to Gloria
      Swanson.</p><p> Each year, the Ransom Center
      seeks to expand and broaden its fellowship program, as well, providing
      funds for scholars to travel to Austin to have direct access to crucial
      primary-source materials. The total reconstruction of the first and second
      floors within the next several years will provide scholars, students and
      visitors with a remarkable new reading room outfitted with computerized
      work stations, along with a new auditorium, audio/visual rooms and a large
      lobby space in which to hold exhibitions.</p><p>Despite
      its recent renown as a center for high-tech millionaires and
      counterculture hipsters, Austin is still not the first place one would
      expect to find, say, Joyce’s hand-corrected galley proofs of <i>Ulysses</i>
      or the self-portraits of Jean Cocteau. But they’re here. And in annually
      increasing numbers, scholars and students from around the world are coming
      to the Ransom Center to discover one of Texas’ best-kept secrets.</p></body>
