      <h1>The Illiad</h1>
      <h3>by John Sledge</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>The
          English poet John Keats (1795-1821) made it famous for us moderns in
          his sonnet "On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer."
          His much-anthologized poem reads:</p><p><i>Much
          have I travell’d in the realms of gold,</i></p><p><i>And
          many goodly states and kingdoms seen,</i></p><p><i>Round
          many western islands have I been,</i></p><p><i>Which
          bards in fealty to Apollo hold,</i></p><p><i>Oft
          of one wide expanse had I been told,</i></p><p><i>That
          deep-brow’d Homer ruled as his demsene,</i></p><p><i>Yet
          did I never breathe its pure serene,</i></p><p><i>Till
          I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold,</i></p><p><i>Then
          I felt like some watcher of the skies,</i></p><p><i>When
          a new planet swims into his ken,</i></p><p><i>Or
          like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes,</i></p><p><i>He
          star’d at the Pacific-and all his men,</i></p><p><i>Looked
          at each other with a wild surmise,</i></p><p><i>Silent,
          upon a peak in Darien.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p>If
          Keats’ sonnet is widely known among 20<sup>th</sup> century American
          college graduates, the work it praises is hardly familiar anymore.
          Now, after being out of print for several years, Chapman’s
          immortal translation of "The Iliad" is once again available in an
          affordable edition, allowing contemporary readers to "breathe its
          pure serene" as did Keats.</p><p>Chapman’s
          Homeric translations stand with Shakespeare’s plays and the King
          James Version of the Bible (published in 1611, the same year as
          Chapman’s "Iliad") as the towering literary achievements of the
          Elizabethan Age. Make no
          mistake, the archaic English of Chapman’s Homer will require some
          getting used to, just as with Shakespeare or the Bible.
          The introduction to the present volume reassures the reader,
          however. "Read
          slowly," editor Allardyce Nicoll writes, "the ‘Iliads’ may
          seem ‘difficult’; read rapidly, it presents surprisingly few
          stumbling blocks in the way of complete appreciation."
          A short glossary is in place to assist with the more unusual
          words and spellings, but on the whole, the usage and pronunciations
          are the same as in Modern English, and in short order, one will find
          oneself breezing through the text, caught up in the tale.</p><p>*
          * *
          *
          * *</p><p>Chapman’s
          efforts at an English translation of "The Iliad" led to several
          earlier versions, the first one being "Seaven Bookes of the Iliades
          of Homere, Prince of Poets" published in 1598. The
          work was printed by John Windet, and was sold "at the signe of the
          Crosse-Keyes near Paules Wharffe."
          As with most significant literary works of the period, "The
          Iliades" had a patron. It
          was dedicated to the Earl of Essex, whom Chapman extolled as "the
          most honored now living instance of the Achillean virtues."
          In 1608, Chapman published another, fuller text, this time
          consisting of twelve books, or half the total length of the original
          poem. Three years later,
          in 1611, the completed work, twenty-four books, was at last published,
          this one dedicated to the "High Borne Prince of Men, Henrie Thrice,
          Royall Inheritor to the United Kingdoms of Great Brittaine, and
          etc."</p><p>In
          his introduction, Chapman declared that "of all bookes extant in all
          kinds, Homer is the first and best."
          He went on to observe that poetry represented an effective
          method of excavating truth. "Nor
          is there any such reality of wisdome’s truth in all humane
          excellence," he wrote, "as in the Poet’s fictions."
          Chapman also wrote a short section on Homer himself, but was as
          limited in his facts as we are today.
          He sagely concluded of Homer that "what he was his workes
          shew most truly."</p><p>For
          the work itself, Chapman employed a difficult and little-used poetic
          technique, that of the fourteener in rhyming couplets.
          The fourteener refers to the fourteen syllables of which each
          line in the poem consists. Within
          each line, there is usually a break, or caesura, at eight syllables
          and six, though Chapman often varied it to avoid a monotonous rhythm. In the poem’s very first lines for instance, we see this
          pattern demonstrated:</p><p>"A/chil/les’
          bane/full wrath re/sound,(pause) O/ God/desse, that im/posd (8 &
          6)</p><p><i>In/fin/ite
          sor/rowes on the Greekes, (pause) and ma/ny brave soules losd (8 &
          6)</i></p><p><i>From
          breasts He/ro/ique-sent from farre, (pause) to that in/vis/i/ble
          cave (8 & 7)</i></p><p><i>That
          no light com/forts; and their lims to dogs and vul/tures gave." (5
          & 9)</i></p><p>Chapman
          chose to use the fourteener because he believed it was closest in
          spirit to the original Greek. If
          sometimes a labor for the general reader, these stately lines do give
          the poem a terrific cumulative power and resonance.</p><p>The
          critical reaction to Chapman’s translation has been admiring down
          the centuries. In 1651,
          Samuel Sheppard wrote his opinion in a short verse:</p><p><i>On
          Mr. Chapman’s incomparable translation of Homers Workes,</i></p><p><i>What
          none before durst ever venture on,</i></p><p><i>Unto
          our wonder is by Chapman done,</i></p><p><i>Who
          by his skill hath made Great Homer’s song,</i></p><p><i>To
          vaile its bonnet to our English tongue,</i></p><p><i>So
          that the learned may well question it,</i></p><p><i>Whether
          in Greek or English Homer writ.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p>Samuel
          Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) expressed a balanced view when he wrote,
          "Chapman’s was Greekified English,--it did not want vigor or
          variety, but smoothness and facility."
          He continued, "Detached passages could not be improved; they
          were Homer writing in English."
          The British poet Algernon Charles Swineburn (1837-1909)
          commented on Chapman’s lines’ "romantic and sometimes barbaric
          grandeur" and "their freshness, strength, and inextinguishable
          fire." The critic
          George Saintsbury (1845-1933) wrote that "For more than two
          centuries they were the resort of all who, unable to read Greek,
          wished to know what Greek was. Chapman
          is far nearer Homer than any modern translator in any modern
          language." And modern
          critic Gary Wills writes that Chapman’s poem "caught fire"
          because of "the consonance" between the "semi-divine heroism of
          the ‘Iliad’s’ warriors and Renaissance humanism."</p><p>Strangely,
          we know not much more about Chapman personally than we do about Homer.
          He was born in 1559 in Hertfordshire to a family of probably
          middling means. He went
          to Oxford and displayed what one contemporary called "a contempt of
          philosophy" but "a close attention to the Greek and Roman
          classics." For reasons
          unknown, he did not graduate, but rather traveled to London to write
          for the theatre. He produced both tragedies, like "Bussy D’Ambois"
          (1607) and comedies, like "May Day" (1611) and "The Widow’s
          Tears" (1612). It is
          not known whether he met Shakespeare, but he did work with Ben Jonson
          on at least one play, "Eastward Ho" (1605).
          Clearly he was diligent, and worked fast.
          Of his character we have only a brief assessment from someone
          who knew him: Chapman was, "a person of most reverend aspect,
          religious and temperate, qualities rarely meeting in a poet."
          Like Homer then, what Chapman was "his workes shew most
          truly."</p><p>*
          * *
          *
          *</p><p>For
          those concerned about violence in entertainment, "The Iliad" could
          be exhibit A. It is a
          dark and bloody tale, full of rapine and murder, lust and strife,
          where the gods and goddesses behave as badly as men and women.
          It is a young man’s story, a warrior’s song, and is not for
          the faint of heart. It
          takes place during the final weeks of the Achaeans’ ten-year siege
          of the city of Troy. In
          the city are King Priam and his many sons, who include Paris and
          Hector. It is young Paris
          who has precipitated the war by kidnapping Helen, the beautiful wife
          of King Menaleus of Sparta. Menaleus
          begs his brother King Agamemnon for help, and a Greek invasion force
          is gathered.</p><p>"The
          Iliad" is full of remarkable things, which suggest it describes
          actual historical events. Among
          these is the famous catalogue of ships, a detailed list of the forces
          contributed to the host by the various Greek towns.</p><p><i>To
          Agamemnon everie towne her native birth commends,</i></p><p><i>In
          double fiftie sable barks. With
          him a world of men,</i></p><p><i>Most
          strong and full of valure went, and he in triumph then,</i></p><p><i>Put
          on his most resplendent armes, since he did overshine,</i></p><p><i>The
          whole heroique host of Greece in power of that designe.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p>Among
          the Greek heroes are Achilles, their mightiest warrior, Ulysses "in
          counsels great," the two Ajaxes and Diomed.
          Early in the poem, Achilles is angered when Agamemnon takes
          away a young Trojan woman he has won, Briseis.
          When Agamemnon’s heralds come to claim her, Achilles declares
          his withdrawal from the fray:</p><p><i>But,
          Heralds, be you witnesses, before the most ador’d,</i></p><p><i>Before
          us mortals and before your most ungentle king,</i></p><p><i>Of
          what I suffer-that, if warre ever hereafter bring,</i></p><p><i>My
          aide in question, to avert any severest bane,</i></p><p><i>It
          brings on others, I am scusde to keepe my aide in wane,</i></p><p>Since
          they mine honour. But
          your king, in tempting mischief, raves,</p><p><i>Nor
          sees at once by present things the future-how like waves,</i></p><p><i>Ills
          follow ills, injustices, being never so secure,</i></p><p><i>In
          present times, but after-plagues, even, then, are seen as sure.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p>While
          Achilles sulks in his tent, the Trojans, led by Hector, sally forth to
          meet the Achaeans and press hard.
          Much of the action throughout the poem is enriched by the use
          of similes, most of them relating to the weather or the hunt, as in
          the following example:</p><p><i>A
          grevious fight-when to the ships and tents of Greece the seas,</i></p><p><i>Brake
          loose and rag’d. But
          when they joynd, the dreadfull Clamor rose,</i></p><p><i>To
          such a height as not the sea, when up the North-spirit blowes,</i></p><p><i>Her
          raging billowes, bellowes so against the beaten shore,</i></p><p><i>Nor
          such a rustling keeps a fire, driven with violent blore,</i></p><p><i>Through
          woods that grow against a hill-nor so the fervent strokes,</i></p><p><i>Of
          almost-bursting winds resound against a grove of Oakes,</i></p><p><i>As
          did the clamor of these hoasts, when both the battels closd.</i></p><p>The
          realities of Bronze Age warfare are brutally conveyed, as when the
          Greek Peneleus kills the Trojan Iloneus:</p><p><i>The
          dart did undergore,</i></p><p><i>His
          eye-lid, by his eye’s deare rootes, and out the apple fell,</i></p><p><i>The
          eye pierc’t through: nor could the nerve that staies the necke
          repell,</i></p><p><i>His
          strong wing’d lance, but necke and all gave way, and downe he dropt,</i></p><p><i>Peneleus
          then unsheath’d his sword, and from the shoulders chopt,</i></p><p>His
          lucklesse head, which downe he threw, the helme still sticking on,</p><p><i>And
          still the lance fixt in his eye; which not to see alone,</i></p><p><i>Contented
          him, but up againe he snatcht and shewd it all,</i></p><p><i>With
          this sterne Brave: ‘Ilians, relate brave Ilioneus’ fall,</i></p><p><i>To
          his kind parents, that their roofes their teares may overrunne.</i></p><p> 
          
          Achilles
          eventually relents, and allows his friend Patroclus to lead his men in
          his armor. Hector kills
          Patroclus, and in a vengeful rage Achilles rejoins the battle.
          His aspect is terrible:
                    <i>So
          every way Achilles and his speare,</i></p><p><i>Consum’d
          the Champanie, the blacke earth flow’d with the veines he tore.</i></p><p><i>And
          look how Oxen (yok’t and driven about the circular floore,</i></p><p>Of
          some faire barne) treade sodainly the thicke sheaves thin of corne,</p><p><i>And
          all the corne consum’d with chaffe; so mixt and overborne,</i></p><p><i>Beneath
          Achilles’ one-hov’d horse shields, speares and men lay trod,</i></p><p><i>His
          axel-tree and chariot wheels all spatterd with the blood,</i></p><p><i>Hurl’d
          from the steeds hoves and the strakes.
          Thus to be magnified,</i></p><p><i>His
          most inaccessible hands in humane blood he died.</i></p><p>Hector
          and Achilles meet in single combat, and Hector is killed.
          Achilles drags his body about the walls behind his chariot and
          declares that dogs will tear it apart.
          This the gods will not countenance, and Jove commands Hector be
          returned to his father. In
          a heartrending scene, King Priam enters Achilles’ tent to bring dead
          Hector home.</p><p>"The
          Iliad" concludes with Hector’s funeral rites.
          The stories of the Trojan Horse and Achilles’ death are told
          in later epic poems such as Virgil’s "Aenaid" (1<sup>st</sup>
          century B.C.).</p><p>The
          English author G. K. Chesterton (1874-1936) once said that no work so
          expressed the deepest emotions of humanity as that of Homer.
          He concluded that the last man alive ought "to quote ‘The
          Iliad’ and die." Should
          this hypothetical last man speak English, he could do no better than
          to choose Chapman’s translation of this magnificent poem.</p></body>
