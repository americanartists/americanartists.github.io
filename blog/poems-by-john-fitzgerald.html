      <h1>Poems</h1>
      <h3>by John FitzGerald</h3>
    </div>

           <body><br></br><b>Adjusting the Loneliness</b><br></br><p>I hear a faucet drip into its puddle, grown to capacity,
          <br></br>
Striving to avoid stagnation, just to know its own emotion,
          <br></br>
In the middle with itself, like a trinity.</p><br></br><p>The goal of essence is overflowing.
          <br></br>
Ultimate unity is not enough for even an ocean.
          <br></br>
It sways back and forth at the sky, as if into a mirror,</p><br></br><p>Reflecting itself in the deep dark light.
          <br></br>
Reground me, engulf me, elate me, drown me,
          <br></br>
I can't get enough without passing out.</p><br></br><p>The sun never goes down, we rise up
          <br></br>
Like mountains in the north block time;
          <br></br>
Up with clouds, that flirt with poetry and roses,</p><br></br><p>Become this scribble, revealed elapsing.
          <br></br>
Bring sandpipers and baby's breath
          <br></br>
Like a tear refracting colors makes a sound.</p><br></br><p>As strong as waves I gaze between.
          <br></br>
Shore is more of an end than it seems -
          <br></br>
The first drop is deepest, the last licks the surface;</p><br></br><p>I remain with the wind, evolved in motion,
          <br></br>
Orchestrating silence into dreams of reality;
          <br></br>
There are chances, and odds, and fates say we meet,</p><br></br><p>There are preconceived notions, rivers and gatherings,
          <br></br>
There are miles between and limitless faces,
          <br></br>
There are endless lines but I can wait.</p><br></br><b>Spirit</b><br></br><p>I remember seeing that bee there, on the windowsill,
          <br></br>
When it was still alive.
          <br></br>
I was on the phone, and even mentioned it</p><br></br><p>Bouncing off the window after sunshine.
          <br></br>
I'm not afraid of bees, I said.
          <br></br>
If I don't want to land, I go higher till the dream ends.</p><br></br><p>That evening, it lit where it still stands,
          <br></br>
Looking wild, though now the slightest breath
          <br></br>
Would knock its wings and legs off.</p><br></br><p>But I leave it there, a reminder of what once was.
          <br></br>
If I look close, from the side, the angle right,
          <br></br>
I see those hairy fibers coming down,</p><br></br><p>The delicate v of antennae is perfect.
          <br></br>
I've heard they shouldn't be able to fly,
          <br></br>
But such thoughts are ridiculous.</p><br></br><p>I've seen it fly.
          <br></br>
Move out from under the dust another way.
          <br></br>
Even join it, if you have to.</p><br></br><p>I thought I could ward off enchantment, and tried,
          <br></br>
But earth slipped me a mystery,
          <br></br>
So I write as if life had more deadlines than ever.</p><br></br><p>I believe those sayings that shake me,
          <br></br>
Feel nature keep making me up,
          <br></br>
As if I have a chance to wonder.</p><br></br><p>I try as best I can to conceal a soul.
          <br></br>
How little can I attest at once
          <br></br>
Without losing the moment?</p><br></br><p>God, if you can name the truth, I dare you.
          <br></br>
We'll all be gone by nine.
          <br></br>
I fell so far for your eyes, I am corrupt,</p><br></br><p>I guess there is a world I swear to.
          <br></br>
I see wind blow, I should mention,
          <br></br>
It opens strong and looks for light.</p><br></br><b>Adam Surrenders Paradise</b><br></br><p>Here's where the cosmos comes back to repay me,
          <br></br>
Crash my computer, shut down my lines,
          <br></br>
Lead me to wishes and cut off my light.
          <br></br>
May some inkling of honesty weigh in my favor.</p><br></br><p>I render existence a force by reaction,
          <br></br>
Cast out my echoes like waves into notions.
          <br></br>
They return like prodigal sons, or convicts,
          <br></br>
For stimulus, destiny, proof, revision.</p><br></br><p>With promises or need, how will time find me?
          <br></br>
I am middleman to future, suspecting nothing.
          <br></br>
Source returns impurity
          <br></br>
The way the ocean spits a body out.</p><br></br><p>A mistake in a random place deceived,
          <br></br>
At the mercy of the word, I linger.
          <br></br>
God, you know I sought beauty, and wisdom.
          <br></br>
I wanted to grow, to cross things out.</p><br></br><p>But things are never good enough,
          <br></br>
I have to name them to be who I am;
          <br></br>
Closer or farther away doesn't matter,
          <br></br>
Just so I'm not at a standstill.</p><br></br><p>I remember turning love down,
          <br></br>
And owe the universe more than can be spoken.
          <br></br>
Yet, insofar as others cry for something I say,
          <br></br>
I confess to having no real choice.</p></body>
