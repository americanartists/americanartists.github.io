      <h1>Intruder</h1>
      <h3>by John Sledge</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>It
          was a gorgeous fall afternoon. The
          air was crisp and clean, the sky a brilliant blue and the Chinese
          Tallow trees ablaze with red and yellow.
          I was working along my back fence, clearing away the dry tangle
          of privet, kudzu and thorn that had run riot all summer.
          With broad strokes of the sling blade I hacked away at the
          dense mass, sending twigs and broken bits of vine flying.
          The westering sun shot golden beams through the debris-filled
          air, and there was no sound but the crash of the blade.
          My barn jacket felt good in the chill, and my dog sat nearby,
          waiting for me to finish. At
          that moment it struck me--I must read some Faulkner.</p><p></p><p>Certain
          authors suit certain moods, and this was clearly a Faulkner moment.
          My choices were limited, however.
          I have only two Faulkner volumes in my personal library, a
          collection of short stories and a Library of America edition featuring
          his four later novels; <book><title>Go Down, Moses</title></book> (1942), <book><title>Intruder in the
          Dust</title></book> (1948), <book><title>Requiem for a Nun</title></book> (1951) and <book><title>A Fable</title></book>
          (1954). I didn’t want
          to read a short story, desiring something more substantial, but
          <book><title>Requiem for a Nun</title></book> and <book><title>A Fable</title></book>
 both seemed too long.
          Having read <book><title>Go Down, Moses</title></book> before, I settled into a chair
          with the volume opened to <book><title>Intruder in the
          Dust</title></book></p><p></p><p>When
          Faulkner asked his publishers for an advance to write this book, he
          told them that it was to be a "blood and thunder mystery novel"
          that would deal forthrightly with the issue of race.
          Its underlying theme was to be, he wrote, the "relationship
          between Negro and White…the premise being that the white people in
          the South, before the North or the govt. or anyone else, owe and must
          pay a responsibility to the Negro." Faulkner wrote the novel in just over a month, and revised it
          in three.</p><p></p><p>Reviews
          were mixed, but widespread, and <book><title>Intruder in the Dust</title></book> sold 15,000
          copies. It was
          Faulkner’s first commercial success, for despite critical acclaim
          for his earlier books, they had been sluggish sellers.
          MGM bought the movie rights for $50,000, and Faulkner used the
          money to buy a sailboat and enlarge his beloved Rowan Oak.</p><p></p><p>Subsequent
          critical opinion on <book><title>Intruder in the Dust</title></book> has been mixed as well,
          but the general consensus is that it lacks the emotional force and
          power of Faulkner’s earlier works.
          The novel is set in Yoknapatawpha County, and centers on a
          black man, Lucas Beauchamp, who is accused of murdering a white man.
          The determination of the white population to lynch Beauchamp is
          thwarted by an unlikely alliance of two teenage boys, one white and
          one black, and an old spinster and a conscientious small-town lawyer,
          both white.</p><p></p><p><book><title>Intruder in the
          Dust</title></book> features Faulkner’s signature stream-of-consciousness
          prose, maddening in its twists and turns and changes of focus.
          Even so, the tale is more straightforward than most of his
          stories (there are few significant temporal digressions, for instance)
          and the narrative drive is strong.
          The book is, in short, a page-turner.</p><p></p><p>There
          are also a number of memorable passages, none more famous than the
          Gettysburg fantasy. As
          Faulkner wrote, "For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once
          but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it’s still not
          yet two oclock on the July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in
          position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the
          woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and
          Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand
          probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for
          Longstreet to give the word and it’s all in the balance, it hasn’t
          happened yet…."</p><p></p><p>If
          <book><title>Intruder in the Dust</title></book> lacks the gravitas of "Absalom, Absalom!"
          or "Light in August," no matter.
          Passages like the foregoing make it well worth the read.
          Those approaching Faulkner for the first time ought to consider
          this novel. It is lean
          and fast and sometimes even dazzling.
          It certainly satisfied me on an autumn evening.</p></body>
