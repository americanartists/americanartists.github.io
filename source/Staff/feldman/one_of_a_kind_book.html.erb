                              <p>Colophon for both books:</p>
                              <p>This one of a kind book was designed and
                              constructed at the Ziggurat Press by Walter
                              Feldman in the spring of 2002. It is one of a
                              series that searches for meaning beyond language.
                              It has been suggested by some that one day a new
                              kind of Rosetta stone may be found that will
                              reveal the complete meaning.</p>
                              <p>It has been confirmed by scholars, however,
                              that part of the message is a prayer for Peace in
                              the 21st century.</p>
