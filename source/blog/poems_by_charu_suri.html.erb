       <body><poem><title>MORNING RITUAL</title><p>And so every morning, plucked jasmine, heavy incense</p><p>and
              the lighting of copper lamps whetted our appetite</p><p>for
              prayer. A sandalwood fragrance thickened.</p><p>Our
              father spooled muslin wicks that licked up pools of oil,</p><p>touched
              his palms and closed his eyes.</p><p>We
              were young, and could not understand</p><p>why
              we whirred slim incense rods round</p><p>the
              statue of Ganesha. "One must pray everyday,"</p><p>he
              said. Scorched by guilt, we nodded, pledged</p><p>our
              mornings to this act.</p><p>She
              watched us quietly, aloof and busy</p><p>with
              house chores. When the session ceased,</p><p>she’d
              pick her broom up, sweep away the ashes,</p><p>steal
              jasmine from the gods and empty oil from the lamps.</p><p>Her
              bracelets clinked, her broom strokes, brusque</p><p>with
              rhythm, became ritual themselves.</p><p>She'd
              give her final pocket penny to the pan-handlers</p><p>who’d
              come at seasonal intervals, without a fuss.</p><p>We
              often tried to coax her to join us,</p><p>but
              she insisted, "I pray differently."</p></poem><poem><title>RURAL PORTRAIT</title><p>Soon
          a ring of girls encircled me,</p><p>black
          eyes poised to question who I was,</p><p>which
          strange city could have fed a woman</p><p>with
          the English tongue. The <i>whys</i>
          and <i>wheres</i></p><p>rolled
          from their throats: guttural sounds that flowed</p><p>from
          a lack of proper education.</p><p>What
          reply could I have offered them?</p><p>A
          blackboard with some chalk to show them joys</p><p>of
          stringing words from <i>a’s</i>
          and z’s? Their mothers</p><p>watched
          me carefully from under a neem’s thick roof.</p><p>Tensing
          silence broke quite suddenly</p><p>when
          from a straw-glazed hut a new parent</p><p>lightly
          stepped, a gurgling boy in her arms.</p></poem></body>
