LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK REVIEW
</p><p>
By Susan Salter Reynolds
June 7, 2009
</p><p>

Tabloid Books: 134 pp. paper
excerpts:
</p><p>

"In this collection of brief encounters with strangers on the streets
of Los Angeles, James P. White proves the poverty of that legacy. He
talks with people at bus stops, in lines, over counters. He talks with
homeless people, elderly people, travelers and the urban overwrought:
"Seeing the world as filled with strangers who threaten us or seeing
it as filled with other people who are like us and who interest us,
makes a difference."
</p><p>
...
</p><p>
The people White talks to, because it is Los Angeles, come from all
over the world. This makes the vignettes even more fascinating -- the
cab driver from Moscow who is the first person White has ever met who
is nostalgic for communism, the Latino man who has learned Japanese
while working in a Japanese restaurant, the Arab who lived in Israel
and proudly calls himself an Israeli Jew. "It is not so unusual," he
tells White. Not unusual but astounding, and fascinating. There is the
young man who looks so much like Jesus -- White learns that it can be
an annoying burden to look like Jesus. Why wouldn't anyone want to
look like Jesus? White wonders. "Why does this man have that face?"
<br/>
...
</p><p>
White has an instinct for gentleness. A homeless man on a bus shows
him the contents of his bag. He wonders about things, about people's
lives. He is interested. This interest has a different quality than
caring or wanting things to be different.
</p><p>
White set out years ago to write a spiritual history of Los Angeles.
Not long into the project he realized "just how easily it could fail
under its own weight." So he wrote this book instead. Something
similar in many ways, but different."

Abel Juarez's Cities</font></a></b><br/><font size="2" color="#CCCCCC">


<p>

Abel Juarez, folk artist from Michoacan, creates imaginative buildings, houses, and churches drawn from his experiences in Mexico and in the U.S.  His small scale sculptures depict his impressions of real life. They are distinguished by bright colors and lighting that create moods of celebration. One gallery owner calls them "Happy" pieces.

            - The beginning of <i>The Magnate</i> shows scenes of skilled skate boarders including Bob Burnquist flying over stairs and railings. These skaters have no limits. Girls are riding the skateboards just as well as the guys.  The art of skateboarding is clear; these are artists. The director shows his control of the moment, capturing the grace and daring of the athletes. The photography deserves an award.

            by Eduardo Correia - Excerpt

            - The experience of watching <i>Adagio Sostenuto</i> is remarkably like being at an opera. The rich visual experience is admirably achieved by Antonio Luis Mendez. Included in the film are two Vermeer and two Rembrandt paintings which go along with the beautiful music by Listz, Debussy, Beethoven, Shubert, and Cohen. The music brings emotional needs to be expressed by the actors and the acting equally makes demands on the music.
