      <h1>Frank Turner Hollon Interview</h1>
      <h3>by John Sledge</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>Frank
          Turner Hollon, 36, author of the newly published novella <book><title>The Pains
          of April</title></book>, is an attorney by day and a writer by night, talented in
          both endeavors but completely unpretentious.
          He is a partner in the Robertsdale firm Holies, Dasinger &
          Hollon, "a good ol’ country firm" he called it during a recent
          interview. His legal
          resume includes law school at Tulane and a four-year stint with
          Baldwin County District Attorney David Whetstone.
          He said he enjoys helping everyday folks with legal issues and
          his straightforward manner no doubt reassures his clients.
          In the evenings, however, Hollon values solitude, the better to
          wrestle words into stories on a yellow legal pad.</p><p></p><p>Hollon
          has been writing since he was a teenager in Slidell, Louisiana.
          He crafted "mostly poetry and short stories," but never
          published any of it. "The
          Pains of April" was written during the 1980s while he was still in
          law school. He showed the manuscript to his family and a few friends, and
          then stuffed it into a box. "I
          kept it under the bed for ten years," he said.
          It was only after overhearing Fairhope bookseller and publisher
          Sonny Brewer speak to a customer about book-making that Hollon decided
          to go for publication. He
          admitted that he was nervous about asking Brewer to evaluate his
          manuscript, since a friend told him not to give it to Brewer unless he
          could handle rejection. As
          it happened, however, Brewer was captivated, as nearly everyone else
          has been who has read "The Pains of April."</p><p></p><p>The
          book is narrated by an 86 year old denizen of a nursing home somewhere
          along the Gulf Coast. Hollon
          said that he chose to write about a man near the end of life because
          he "wanted clarity." At the time he wrote the book he was going through some
          personal tribulation, and actually wished he were much older, looking
          back on his troubles. He
          was also deeply moved by visits with his 90 year old grandfather, who
          "seemed so afraid" and often burst into tears when talking about
          his own past. Hollon
          wondered how his life and personal problems would be assessed from
          such "a further perspective," and so he put pen to paper in
          something of a thought experiment.</p><p></p><p>For a
          young man to convincingly and humanely portray a character over half a
          century his senior requires keen psychological insight and deft
          literary ability. Frank Turner Hollon scores high in both categories.
          Early readers and reviewers of "The Pains of April" have
          been impressed with Hollon’s achievement and have praised his
          compelling voice and stylistic craft.
          Fairhope writer Judith Richards called his writing "fluent in
          the elements of literature," and native Mobilian and literary
          wunderkind Michael Knight lauded his "abundant honesty and humor." Robert Bell, author of "The Butterfly Tree," wrote the
          introduction to the book, and stated, "So few writers understand
          style anymore, but Mr. Hollon does."</p><p></p><p>Hollon
          is presently at work on a much longer novel, something "more
          commercial" and "very different" from "The Pains of April,"
          also to be published by Over the Transom Books.
          When he is not lawyering or writing, Hollon plays Whiffle Ball,
          runs (he has completed the New York marathon twice) and reads literary
          classics. He has just
          bought "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by Ernest Hemingway and said that
          he needs to reread, for the eighth time, his favorite novel, "The
          Fountainhead," by Ayn Rand. "I
          love the characters," he declared.
          Frank Turner Hollon bears watching.
          He is a promising new light in the local literary firmament,
          and is good enough to go far indeed.</p></body>
