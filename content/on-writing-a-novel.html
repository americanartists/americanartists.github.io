      <h1>On Writing a Novel: Three Letters from John Clellon Holmes</h1>
      <h3>by James White</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>When at thirty I arrived at Brown University as a new graduate
          student in the writing program, I had never taken a creative writing
          class. I had published roughly a dozen stories, but had not met any
          novelist, or for that matter, another short story writer. I had
          studied and taught history. I had fearfully avoided creative writing
          classes because my sophomore American literature professor during a
          summer class at Arlington State Junior College, warned me: "Never
          think of being a writer," after I had shown her my poems.</p><p>The afternoon that I walked into the English building at Brown
          and climbed the stairs to John Clellon Holmes's office, I did not know
          the campus at all.I had decided to live in New York City rather than Providence.
          I would commute to class. Locating Holmes's office, I felt as if one
          second had passed since I'd been discouraged at the junior college. I
          had sent Holmes my work; it was in his possession. I had read two of
          his three novels:<i> Go</i>, and <i>Get Home Free</i>. I had bought
          the third, <i>The Horn</i>. He was the first of the Beat Generation
          writers to have a novel published and a close friend of Jack Kerouac's.
          I knocked on the door. "Come in," Holmes answered.</p><p>He had big eyes and wore glasses. His smile was evident. My
          impression of him was blurred because of my nervousness. I sat down,
          as he did.</p><p>"I don't know what you're doing at Brown," he said.</p><p>My worst fears were realized. Why hadn't he just told me not to
          come?</p><p>"You're the best student in the program," he said.
          "You're already a writer. Go back to New York and write. We can
          correspond about it."</p><p>I felt as if something joyous and fragile had been created--his
          liking the stories I'd written while reading history day and night. I
          thanked him enthusiastically.</p><p>Although we would correspond for twenty years, I was to see him
          only once more--at the Providence train station one late afternoon
          several months later. I spotted him twenty feet away and immediately
          went in the opposite direction and hid. I worried that his knowing me
          better might jeopardize his liking my work. Perhaps it was like not
          wanting to disturb the calm surface of a body of water. Certainly, it
          was insecurity.</p><p>During that academic year (1971-72), he wrote me letters
          resplendent with skills of a master teacher. I anticipated each
          letter, and took his advice the best I could. We would continue to
          correspond until shortly before his death, but I would never meet him
          again.</p><p>From the first letter about an unpublished novella I had
          written, he showed unusual generosity and care for a novice writer. I
          quote the letter entirely because of what I now see it reveals of
          Holmes as a teacher. I have taught writing in college since I left
          Brown in 1973. In fact, since 1977, I have taught fiction writing
          exclusively. I have known literally hundreds of other writing
          teachers, but I suspect that none would have taken the trouble that
          Holmes did.</p><p>He took the time to write in detail; he encouraged in
          extraordinary ways. Too, he commented about his own work, which was
          another compliment. His earnestness about the situation I faced,
          showed everywhere. Surely no writing student could have found more
          expert advice than what he gave me. His letters could serve as a goal
          for writing teachers. I hardly remember the novella, <i>Pot of Ivy</i>,
          other than as a springboard for his extraordinary letters. The first
          letter I've chosen to quote also should be of value to anyone who has
          need to work on plotting narrative:</p><q><p>January
          1, 1971</p><p>Dear
          Jim:</p><p>I
          apologize for the amount of time it's taken me to read POT OF IVY.
          Things at Brown have been unusually hectic, and I wanted time, and
          quiet, so I saved the book for Christmas vacation.</p><p>It's
          the best piece of work you've ever done. It has an accomplished mood,
          characters that live the way people live--mysteriously, uniquely, and
          above all it has an authorial-tone that allows you to move into, and
          away from, and around the central event. Again, I am struck by your
          skills. Your style is, with some lapses, absolutely assured,
          beautifully concise and yet evocative of more than lies on the
          surface, capable of suggesting so much more than it says, sometimes
          almost Jamesian in its overtones. Fain, of course, is a marvelous
          character, and you give him to us so obliquely. The book is taut with
          his enigmatic presence, with his increasingly encapsulated life, the
          prisoner of taste, this lonely soul surrounded by<i> things</i>. Yes,
          the style here is better than in the stories. For one thing, it
          characterizes the narrator. It has, at once, warmth of observation
          (that is, what is described is bathed in feelings), and a necessary
          detachment, and your usual marvelous feel for the incongruity (Sugie,
          for example, is a terrific character, she whisks thru the book like an
          antic pseudo-muse).</p><p>There's
          something very moving about the book. I think it has to do with a
          feeling of the incommunicability of certain lives. I kept thinking of
          Fitzgerald's long story, THE RICH BOY, because Fain is rather like the
          protagonist of that story. Gifted, narrow, special, ultimately
          separated from other people by his own conception of his life. you've
          managed to bring him to us, from the outside, very strongly. The
          "group of friends", also, are done very well. I believe them
          as friends, I believe them as a group, I understand why they are
          there, and yet you spend so little time establishing this. It's
          marvelous.</p><p>The
          structure, of course, is a set-up. You handle it well. A central,
          conclusive event, occurring after a separation, from which the
          narrator muses back on the enigma of personality. I found myself
          saying, during that last-but-one scene of Fain and his mother at the
          graveside, "How does the narrator know this? Shit, what does it
          matter?" That's how well the preparation had worked. If I have
          any cavils, they are all in the area of "plot". Again,
          almost nothing happens in this story. I feel you succumbing to your
          unique gift for characterization time after time, characterization
          that is based on your observations rather than on actions by the
          characters. There is almost no development in the novel; it has a
          sense of the emptiness, the aimlessness, of provincial life that
          reminded me of Chekhov, but I felt you shying away from any big,
          pivotal scenes. When we talked, I mentioned that I got a feeling of
          overdone subtlety about some of your work. I think it's present in the
          novel, too. Fain's "secret", as the narrator describes it,
          was not clear enough, weighty enough to hold up the end. I think that
          considerations such as these make the book seem slighter than it
          really is. Of course, it's short anyway, but as it stands it has more
          the quality of a character-sketch ( a sketch done with great
          perception and sensitivity) than a novel, in which we should come to
          see below the surface of appearances, some to understand motivations,
          observe changes. Fain changes, of course, but I missed having a scene
          where Fain unmasks himself, where we get some indication of his
          awareness of how isolated he has become. You tell us a lot of this,
          but telling is never as good as showing. Again, I feel you backing off
          from really dramatic scenes, so that the primary time-level (the day
          of the funeral) and the secondary time-level (all the flashbacks and
          memories) have a tonal similarity that fails to distinguish them,
          aesthetically, from one another. For instance, inthe matter of the funeral itself: you describe it for the most
          part in flat narration, and yet it is the signal event of the book, it
          is the event around which the whole book turns. Always, I find you
          more at ease when you can muse, analyze, describe, explain and you are
          least assured when you are building up a scene, catching a real moment
          that is developing towards something more. I don't mean to stress that
          this"dramatic" deficiency too much, but I think you ought to
          spend some thought on it. Go back and read THE RICH BOY, for instance.
          It's not much shorter than IVY, and as I say there are certain
          similarities between the two works: they are narrated by a person
          connected to the essential action, but only indirectly. They cover a
          span of time that is roughly similar. Both works are equally alive to
          social nuance. But if you break down Fitzgerald's story you will see
          that he has skillfully alternated passages of straight narration with
          small, but telling dramatic scenes which heighten it. Another writer
          that I think of in connection with your work is Katharine Mansfield.
          Go read PRELUDE (or indeed any of the longish, autobiographical New
          Zeeland-stories), and you'll see this same thing happen: narration,
          characterization, alternated with scenes of action, even though some
          of the scenes involve only a page or two of dialog.</p><p>What
          I mostly want to do at this stage of the game is to encourage you.
          Your work gets tighter, more ambitious, and more controlled all the
          time. You should now worry less about your prose and more about
          structure, motivation and action. Your style has an authority, and a
          beauty, and a range that are already exceptional. I'm a little afraid
          that you may stand in danger of indulging this gift at the expense of
          action, "plot", structure. When in doubt, you seem to fall
          back on further explications of Fain's character, and after a while
          the reader hungers to <i>see</i> Fain doing things, to observe these
          people in interaction, to witness the mystery of reality as it
          happens. You have all the necessary gifts, and are acquiring a lot of
          the important skills, but I think you have to spend more time on the
          meat and potatoes of fictionalizing. you have to ask yourself just
          what a story is, what it accomplishes, why it moves us. Take any two
          longest stories, or novellas, that are favorites of yours, that move
          you, and re-read them less for the felicities of their styles than for
          the hard bones on which the flesh of the prose hangs. Even make a
          graph of the movements in the stories: the pivots, the turns, the
          points where the story moves on, and what these points accomplish.
          Then try to make a like graph of the action in your own work: how A
          leads to B, which in turn either moves toward C or back towards A,
          etc.</p><p>Of
          course, we can correspond, and of course it will be a pleasure to work
          with you during the spring semester. As to my own imagery, I approach
          it very deliberately The first thing I try for is what I call
          verisimilitude. It must refer directly, and as economically as
          possible to the reader's idea of reality. Imagery, after all, is
          simply a short hand which everyone can read. One wants to find an
          image that will reverberate in the reader's mind; it's <i>his</i>
          associations that I want to release, not so much my own. I'm a firm
          believer in Carlos Williams' dictum: "No ideas but in
          things." For years I tended to write an explanatory, analytical,
          abstract kind of prose. I tended to exposition, and it took me a long
          time to root this urge out of my work--I've never fully succeeded. In
          THE HORN I found myself trying to get a richer, more evocative
          prose-density, something rather along the lines of Melville's chapter
          on the Pacific in Moby Dick. But psychology, if you will, or
          character, remained, still, my strongest fascination. THE HORN
          suffers, it seems to me, from being mythologized, its prose is far too
          rhythmic, too elegiac. It lacks humor, verve, crudity, sweat. What I
          was trying to do when I got to THE RAW MATERIALS sections of NOTHING
          MORE TO DECLARE was to strip everything away that smacked of
          over-explanation, and to snare the meanings within the imagery, and
          above all to break down the mesmerizing unfolding of the long
          sentence. I wanted, in other words, to attempt to establish the very
          real differences between eloquence and rhetoric. I'm still working on
          it, and the novel that's underway right now is written in the first
          person, it's slangy and idiomatic, and the problem to is get to
          maximum intensity and still leave myself prose-room to expatiate and
          comment, and thus, hopefully, deepen the significances of the
          material. It's a continuing process. In my own case, I was lucky
          enough to conceive a passion for Dostoyevski and the Russians when I
          started out writing seriously. From them, I learned a lot about
          scene-building, about confrontations between characters, about
          dramatic action in terms of dialog. My first novel was very crude as a
          work of prose, but it had movement, conflict, a sense of time passing,
          because of my study of how Dostoyevski achieved his mammoth emotional
          and philosophical effects. Then, naturally, I became concerned about
          the deficiencies in my style, and succumbed to an equally
          long-standing love of Melville and Shakespeare, etc., and in THE HORN
          I tried for far more than it explicitly said. I was unhappy with the
          results, though I'll stand on the book, and went on to try to hone the
          style in the service of the story, to use it instead of being used by
          it. These days I find myself far more interested in motivations, in
          movements, in content, particularly from a thematic point of view. I'm
          trying for a greater objectivity on my own part, so that deeper levels
          of meaning and complexity can be gotten into the work. It's extremely
          difficult, but a late-blooming appreciation of James is a great help.
          A few years ago, I had occasion to teach THE AMBASSADORS, which I
          hadn't read for years, and for my own instruction I made up a kind of
          outline of the book as I read along: that is, I tried to sum up in two
          or three lines what each chapter accomplished in terms of the story.
          It was a revelation. Thematically, the book was revealed as being
          almost orchestral in its structure: theme and counter-theme,
          development and arrest, crescendo and diminuendo It doesn't matter
          whether this was fully conscious on James' part, it is the reason for
          the book's greatness, and surely it came from a clear notion, in
          James' mind, of just what the book was going to be about. The same can
          be done with Bellow's HERZOG, with ABSALOM ABSALOM, and most other
          great novels. I stress all this because I feel, as I've said above,
          that you need to work harder, and think deeper, on these aspects of
          fiction. Do you like plays? You might go back and read some of
          Tennessee Williams', just to bring yourself more alive to structure.
          Fain, after all is very like the unseen-hero of SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER,
          and Williams approaches his character on-a-slant, more or less as you
          have with Fain. And yet Williams uses any number of devices to
          gradually reveal the true nature of his character. The revelations
          come slowly, enigmatically, but they do come, and the cathartic effect
          of the whole work is directly connected to the gradualness of our
          understanding.</p><p>Well,
          as per your instructions, I'll hold onto the first part of the new
          novel, and not comment on it now. When you're ready, you have only to
          drop me a line, and I'll write you my impressions. Again, let me
          emphasize that I think A POT OF IVY is a great leap forward. It can't
          say if it will be published (to read the minds of editors and
          publishers one has to combine the talents of a swami and a con man),
          but it was well worth doing, and you ought to feel a great deal of
          assurance having brought it off.</p><p>Hope
          you can keep in victuals (victuals? vittles?) long enough to give the
          new book a good, solid GO. Write me whenever you think I can be of any
          help. And we can get together if you think that would be valuable, or
          correspond in the meanwhile.</p><p>Best,</p><p>John
          Clellon Holmes</p></q><p>Holmes's sensibility of writing his thoughts down, is clearly
          shown in this letter. Here is someone committed to the written word
          and not just in creating fiction. One can not help but admire his
          patience, and wish for a collection of his letters.</p><p>This past year I taught an excerpt from <i>The Horn</i> to a
          Form and Theory of Fiction class. The students responded to his prose
          and were interested in his letters as well. They found an originality
          in the style that led several to read his novels and express
          admiration. The following passage from <i>The Horn</i> shows Holmes'
          dense, reflective style:</p><p>Edgar fingered lazily, ignoring Cleo's solid, respectful
          chords, one shoulder swinging back and forth slightly, his chin pulled
          in. His hair was long over his large collar, he padded up and down on
          exaggerated crepe soles, between solos he chewed an enormous wad of
          gum soaked in benzedrine. They said he had "gone queer," but
          there was something soft and sexless about him nonetheless. Then he
          smeared a few notes over a pretty idea--a crooked smile glimmering
          behind the mouthpiece, all turned in upon himself, all dark; and
          Walden alone seemed to catch the sinister strain of self-ridicule
          behind the phrase, behind the sloppy, affected suit, the fairy
          hip-swinging; and at that moment the presence of a secret in Edgar
          reached him light a light.</p><p>For if jazz was a kind of growing Old Testament of the Negro
          race--and of all lost tribes in America, too--a testament being
          written night after night by unknown, vagrant poets on the spot (and
          so Walden, reared on a strange Biblical confusion, often thought of
          it), then Edgar had once been a sort of <i>Genesis</i>, as inevitable
          and irreducible as the beginnings of things; but now, mincing,
          chewing, flabby, he sounded the bittersweet note of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>,
          ironical in his confoundment...</p><p>As a graduate student I was interested in my professors' work,
          and when I could, asked them about it. Partly, I wanted to know them
          better personally, but also I had little information as to how writers
          thought and what kinds of work habits they had. I wrote Holmes,
          inquiring about the novel he was writing. The second letter, selected
          from a number, points out the complexity of shaping a narrative idea
          and the difficulty of structuring plot and theme. His awareness of
          technique is part of what makes a novel one piece. The amount of time
          that can be involved, the number of attempts tried and failed, and the
          need to throw away pages, are important concepts for a young writer to
          learn. At the end of the letter he refers to my health. I was
          experiencing a mysterious, unidentified internal bleeding that
          couldn't be identified or stopped for over a year. The physician
          suggested that I warn my professors that I might hemorrhage at any
          moment in class.</p><p>Any young novelist would greatly benefit from reading this
          letter which indicates what he has in store for him:</p><q><p>August
          4, 1972</p><p>Dear
          Jim:</p><p>Sorry
          it's taken me so long to get back to you. Immediately after closing up
          shop in Providence, I went to Maine for a while to work on our little
          clammer's shack up there, and get a rest. When I got back, I had a
          long (and long overdue) magazine piece to finish, and now we're off
          again to Maine for the rest of August.</p><p>You
          ask about the novel I'm working on; how do I approach it? Well, the
          kernal of the idea came to me a long time ago. It came first as a
          one-act play, which never got beyond the most desultory note-taking. A
          few years later, I realized that it was a novel--that is, that I was
          as much interested in the three main characters as I was in the
          "plot"-idea. It expanded itself naturally, still keeping the
          severe time-limit-actions of the play-idea, but fleshed out with
          backgrounds, a stronger, denser sense of miieu, flashbacks, and other
          subsidiary characters. It germinated for a long time while I was
          engaged in doing another book. In 1969, I started to get down to work
          on it, filling a large loose-leaf workbook with notes, sections of
          prose, and references to journal-entries that were germane to the
          project. I started serious prosing in early 1970 after a trip to Los
          Angeles (which is the setting of the book), but immediately had
          problems of "entry": I had thought to begin the book a year
          after the major action, and then drop back. This proved unweildy (sic)
          and cumbersome. I spent a month trying to solve that difficulty and
          realized that I had conceived the book in the wrong point of view. I
          made a shift from third to first person, and started the book directly
          in the middle of the penultimate action (the last day of a
          complicated, three-way relationship), and it went along fine. I wrote
          the first three chapters (of a possible eight or ten) in a couple of
          months. Much of this time was spent getting into the specifics of my
          character's tone--a complicated tone in that he is a wry, somewhat
          involuted type, who is addressing the reader, and slips back and forth
          from the first to the third person. That is, he sometimes speaks of
          himself as if he was speaking of someone else. The viewpoint, as well,
          is complicated (perhaps the major theme of the book has to do with
          identity-sense, and so there's a lot of role-playing, masquerade, and
          mirroring), and this took time to get accustomed to. By the third
          chapter, something of a digression, the thing was starting to open up.
          A minor character, and her involvements, abruptly became more
          important; I saw reflections of the basic situation in this
          character--reflections which, towards the end of the book, will become
          more important, and will serve to build the thing more forcefully
          towards its end. Then in the fourth chapter, I struck my first serious
          snag. It wasa flashback (which I usually like doing), and I hadn't thought
          very much about it in advance, but when I got going on it the prose
          turned bad, my selectivity-gieger-counter went dead, I wrote reams and
          reams of stuff that I knew I didn't need. This went on for months
          until I realized that I had placed this particular flashback in the
          wrong spot. I moved along better for a time, though I still had an
          uneasy feeling. Then I ran entirely out of money, and had to stop and
          do magazine-articles, go back to Los Angeles to do a long piece on
          that city for PLAYBOY, an then the job at Brown came along, which put
          the book off until now.</p><p>How
          do I work? I work in the morning usually, and usually for no more than
          four-five hours. If I'm hot, I continue, but more than five hours is
          about as long as anyone can take. I tend to write slowly, and re-write
          as I go along. I like to have fairly finished product behind me. if I
          write five hundred words a day it's a good day. In recent years, I've
          been writing a little faster than that, and usually at the end of a
          scene it goes rapidly--up to a thousand sometimes in a few hours. I
          try to work every day, but there are times when you realize you
          haven't solved the problems, and until you do there's no point in
          going forward. I guess the way I conceive a novel these days might be
          described as a process of ACCRETION. If I have the strong central
          situation, and the characters, I find that other, necessary things and
          people and reactions attach themselves naturally, or emerge worrying
          it too much, and then later I go back and see what's out of
          proportion, what needs to be built up, etc. I go a lot by<i> feel</i>,
          how it feels, how it sort of<i> hefts </i>in the mental--hand. I think
          a lot of structural-sense comes from this sense of feel. It has to do
          with a feeling for proportion, nuance, balance--it's very
          architectural, and I'm not sure one can "learn" it, except
          by reading and becoming more sensitive to balance, etc. The only
          unities (in the Aristotelian sense) that apply to the novel are, I
          suppose, a feeling for limiting, or compressing, your material so that
          maximum aesthetic-tensions build-up, a sense of how a story can be
          made to move forward by grounding it in time (which is the heart of
          the novel), and the crucial importance of a strong sense of milieu
          that will make the characters vivid because of the sense of
          "world" that the reader gets. I used to be far more hungup
          on prose than I am now I strove for "fine" writing, every
          sentence a jewel. This slowed things up for me, and I think did the
          same thing for the reader. Now I'm more interested in getting<i> flow</i>,
          in breaking up the rhythms, and picking up the pace. I've found that <i>story</i>
          is far more important than I used to believe. By that I think I mean, <i>movements</i>,
          pivots, hinges. The difference between a novel and a short story lies
          in this matter of movements: a story has only one or at most two. A
          novel never has less than three. These <i>changes</i> (in character,
          in situation, etc.) are what relate the novel to time, to a feeling of
          the passage of time. Any great novel can be reduced to these bare
          bones. Reducing it does it damage in the reader's mind (even if the
          reader is a writer), but the process makes it clearer to the writer
          how structure functions in producing the "feeling" of a
          given book. Hemingway, for instance, was basically a short-story
          writer. When he comes to the novel, he is often on unsure ground, and
          that's why you get those magnificent set-pieces in all his novels (the
          Retreat from Caporetto, El Sordo on the mountain, the last section of
          ISLANDS IN THE STREAM), set-pieces that often seem far more assured
          and memorable than the novels in which they occur, set-pieces that, on
          investigation, we see to be marginal to the basic action of the books.
          They are, in effect, short stories.</p><p>Tolstoi,
          who does great battle scenes too, perhaps the best of all, never uses
          them as digressions (sic), separate narratives, but always as climaxes
          for some far more important interior event in his characters lives.
          Dostoyevski, on the other hand, rarely writes set-pieces. His novels
          move gigantically along by a process of ever-intensifying
          acceleration--the method of the thriller until his great climaxes (the
          trial in Karamazov, Raskolikov's confession, the various murders in
          THE POSSESSED) cap everything off. his method is dramatic: huge,
          intense scenes placed cheek by jowl with one another like massive
          building blocks, with very little narrative connective. This is
          perhaps why so many attempts have been made to transform his novels to
          the stage or the screen--most of them dismal failures--and failures
          because his scenes are bigger than life, they explode time. Faulkner
          works with a kind of mythic flow, he's very Greek in some ways, his
          people are all doomed, driven by forces they barely comprehend, tiny
          figures in a vast, exotic landscape of fates. But he, too, is always
          moving forward, and he keeps the reader's attention by a series of
          hints-at-future-action, by deliberately withheld information, by a
          process (influenced by Conrad) of continual circling-back. One could
          go on. there are limitless possibilities in structuring one's
          material, but they all involve a <i>feel</i> of proportion,
          attention-riveting, and moving the ball forward. Modern material,
          modern experience, has demanded all kinds of new techniques, but they
          are all attempts to solve the same old problems, the major one of
          which is simply to keep the reader reading ahead. I have found that a
          strong grip on <i>theme</i> is often a help in these matters, because
          it gives the writer a yardstick by which to measure what is needed,
          what isn't; what to cut, what to expand. The writer must continually
          ask himself: what is this book <i>about</i>? Because of the length of
          time that it takes to write a novel this question must be repeated
          over and over again.</p><p>For
          myself, I find that I can't hurry a novel. that is, I'm constantly
          learning more about it, cautiously digging its shape out of
          nothingness, and often I don't know precisely how it's going to turn
          out until I'm well along in it. Not one novel of mind, except the very
          first, has come out the way I thought it would when I conceived it,
          and even the death which ends GO didn't occur until I'd written almost
          half the book. THE HORN changed drastically as it went along , and
          deepened too as I saw more possibilities. GET HOME FREE was literally
          conceived backwards, and the hardest parts to write were the three New
          York sections. The book suffers a sort of structural schizophrenia as
          a result. The current novel is strong and simple structurally, and yet
          I have to beware of becoming too rigid, too imprisoned by the movement
          of my own events. The danger here is that I'll scant all the
          "little lower layers", without which it won't work at all.
          Yet if I succumb to the delight of my leading character's tone,
          comments, etc. the book will be self-indulgent and outre. Again, a
          question of finding, and striking, a balance.</p><p>Novel-writing
          is the hardest work I know. At times one can suffer what feels like an
          actual mental unbalance from trying to get into a character's head.
          It's very unnatural. Yet, for me, the creation of believable
          characters is the ball game, people that live, whom we understand
          below the level of mere intelligence, about whom we intensely care.
          For me, character is still the core of the novel, but I mean this in
          Fitzgerald's sense that "action is character". What a
          character <i>does</i> defines him. A writer knows that he's getting it
          when a character starts acting more or less on his own, when the
          action emerges out of the character without the author's intervention.
          The best characters I ever wrote ended up writing themselves. They
          took on a life that seemed utterly independent of me and my initial
          conceptions of them. The ones that worked best for me were STOFSKY in
          GO, EDGAR in THE HORN, and MAY in GET HOME FREE. But perhaps this has
          to do with the amount of difficulty I had in getting them to walk and
          talk on their own...</p><p>These
          are a few very unsystematic reflections, just what comes to mind this
          morning. Of course you can continue to write to me, and I'll answer
          any questions that you have. If my replies are tardy sometimes, I know
          you'll understand it's because I've got my head down in the well.</p><p>In
          any case, I hope you have a great year at Brown, and I'm glad you're
          getting out of New York. Also, that your health improves. I can't
          write a coherent sentence when I have as much as a head cold.</p><p>All
          the best,</p><p>John</p></q><p>This letter is remarkable in expressing the confusion and work
          that each novelist faces. Holmes's skills, integral to his fiction, of
          delineating what a character is confronting in life, in his thoughts,
          and trying to come to some resolution, are shown in this letter as
          well. That he would write it to a graduate student he didn't know
          well, but whose work he encouraged, is probably more understandable to
          a writer.</p><p>The third letter I've selected concerns the first draft of my
          first novel published,<i>Birdsong</i>. After I read this letter, I threw away all but
          the first thirty pages of a five hundred page manuscript. I did so
          gladly, the letter encouraging me. I subsequently rewrote the novel to
          five hundred pages, then discarded allbut the first thirty pages again. I then wrote the final
          version, about one hundred eighty pages. Curiously, a few years later,
          I was introduced by an English chairman at a California University who
          stated: "I'd like to say I admire this book. I think it is real
          literature, except for the first thirty pages."</p><p>Again, Holmes' letter encourages, probably the most important
          tool of the writing teacher. He is urging me to concern myself with
          exactly what he writes of in the second letter--rethinking the
          narrative. It is, of course, what I did. And what a pleasant way to be
          taught! His encouragement in the last paragraphs meant a lot to me,
          and gave me the needed confidence to throw away pages and restart.</p><q><p>April
          23, 1972</p><p>Dear
          Jim,</p><p>I've
          read the novel, and wanted to get word to you as soon as possible.</p><p>I
          think it's mostly good. The writing is a joy: clean, lithe prose;
          perceptive and lean. I think you've got your instrument now. You write
          with authority, you're free of mannerisms. at your best, you write
          very fine stuff--that is, your writing has an individual tone, a Jim
          White tone. I think this book is probably the best thing you've done
          so far. The first half is absolutely assured. you have humor now, you
          have distance, there's an ironic warmth in the writing about all our
          yesterdays that I found marvelous. You move from Dewey to Alice with a
          certain calm rightness that is a pleasure. Alice, particularly is
          something of a triumph, because doing a girl this intimately is
          difficult. The admission of love between them is convincing and
          moving. Also, I liked the army-stuff.</p><p>The
          problem, as far as I see it: the book makes a strange shift from t<i>hem</i>
          to<i> him.</i> It gets subjective, and ends up somehow inconclusively.
          I think I felt this shift about the time that he joins the army. That
          is, the focus changes there: Alice tends to disappear, to become less
          the other half of a single relationship and more a kind of foil. It's
          evidenced in the technique. You suddenly go into first person. I felt,
          in fact, that Dewey's army experience had been written before you got
          down to do this book. The writing's good, the insights work, butit's<i> different,</i> and the reader pulls up short, he's
          jerked out of the flow of the book. I don't think you gain anything by
          this shift.</p><p>What
          I'm trying to say is this: you have created a strong and moving
          account of young love: Dewey and Alice are wonderfully individualized,
          you catch love in America in all its poignancy and unlikeliness, your
          authorial tone is assured; and then, somewhere just after college,
          just before he joins the army, the focus seems to blur a little. I
          didn't quite understand why they didn't see one another, why Dewey
          failed to call. You've done the relationship between them better than
          you know. there seems to be a missing piece: had they drifted apart?
          Did they have a fight? The reader has been delicately poised <i>inside</i>
          their intimacy, and suddenly he's outside it. he feels more intensely
          than Dewey seems to.</p><p>The
          book doesn't end with any rounding-off. Does Dewey go AWOL? Towards
          what are he and Alice moving? I miss her in these last sections. I
          want to know what she's feeling. I want that sense of marvelous
          intimacy (with her, as well as him) that makes the first half of the
          book so good. Also, there is a fuzziness in some of the
          army-prose---bad sentences, too over-packed and too-abstract--that
          indicates uncertainty on your part, particularly because of the swift,
          telling and assured prose of the rest of the book. It's <i>their</i>
          story, not just his.</p><p>I
          think you have to sit down and think about the overall shape of the
          book. It needs a finish. Dewey is curiously will-less. Where is he
          heading? How has marriage changed him? What does Alice do during the
          weeks when he's on the base? Does he miss her? What does he want for
          the rest of his life? Has the fact that he considers leaving the army
          affected them? How? One of the most interesting moments is when Alice
          seems about to urge him to go over the hill. We yearn to know more.</p><p>What
          you have here is a fine account of the birth of love, done with
          marvelous impartiality (you write Alice with admirable perception into
          females), and then, somehow, it turns into a young-man-in-the-army
          story--all good, but not the same thing, not what we've been led to
          expect. It's the tone of objectivity, of sympathy and humor and
          largeness that gets lost. Would it be possible for you to re-think the
          last third? Can't Dewey do something? Can't the army sections be
          angled towards their married-relationship? Can't Dewey realize what
          she means to him, or doesn't? The reader badly needs a sense of
          authorial perspective at about this point.</p><p>These
          are simply just-up-from-the manuscript meanderings. I can't tell you
          how solid your writing is now. you need to think less about your prose
          and more bout structure, nuance, and the mysterious rounding-off that
          makes a novel emotionally satisfying. I've told you before that you
          don't have to worry about your writing--you write marvelously--but you
          do have to think about the even-deeper aesthetic questions of overall
          shape, of architecture, of the "dying fall". we owe the
          reader a completion of the emotional expectations that we have
          aroused. I think the second half of the book needs to be re-thought,
          and re-written. Ask yourself, baldly, what the book is about: it's
          about Dewey and Alice; it's about love's unlikeliness; it's about
          hope.</p><p>Mostly,
          I believe in your future as a writer. You have perception, sympathy, a
          good eye and ear, and you work hard. That's all you need. I'd say
          this: get out of New York if you can, get to a calm and supportive
          life, believe in yourself. I'm sure you're going to make it. Your
          prose has that kind of inevitability about it. It's important that you
          maintain the right perspective about your work and your life. Take
          time off. Remember oleanders. Enjoy the drama of your own sensibility.
          There's time.</p><p>I
          haven't had a chance at WIVES yet. I'll get to it in a week or two.
          The semester gathers toward doom, towards the dark avalanche of
          last-minute, grade-assuming work. I have over 100 students, and
          sometimes I can't even remember my own name. In any case, keep in
          touch, and don't despair. if I can help, you have only to ask.</p><p>Best,</p><p>John.</p></q><p>This letter was the best possible guide to what I was
          struggling with in my novel manuscript, and helped me focus. That
          Holmes could write it while teaching one hundred students, startles
          me.</p><p>Even now, at nearly sixty, I learned something new from his
          letters while preparing this article. He writes, in a letter dated
         August 19, 1979:</p><q><p>The
          writer's problem, seems to me, is basically lack of confidence during
          the years it sometimes takes to harden up one's personal voice and
          habits, and make (as Eliot says somewhere) certain "meek
          adjustments". As I get older, I'm more interested in writing what
          I want to write, rather than tooling it for the current taste...</p></q><p>Holmes' work, besides the three novels (<i>Go,</i> Charles
          Scribners, 1952; <i>The</i> H<i>orn</i>, Random House, 1958; <i>Get
          Home Free</i>, E.P. Dutton, 1964), includes <i>Nothing More to Declare</i>
          (E.P. Dutton, 1967), a collection of essays about the Beat Generation.
          The essays first appeared in <i>Esquire, The New York Times, Playboy</i>,
          and other magazines. In 1977, Holmes published a collection of poems <i>The
          Bowling</i><i>Green Poems</i>, printed as Volume 7 of a literary
          review,<i> The Unspeakable Vision of</i><i>the Individual</i>. He
          died of cancer in 1988.</p></body>
