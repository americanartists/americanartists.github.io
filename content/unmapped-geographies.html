      <h1>Unmapped Geographies A Review of </h1>
      <h3>by Charles Sweetman</h3>
    </div>

          In 1997, Rainer Schulte spoke to the
          American Literary Translators Association commenting about how his own
          work as a translator affects the way he interprets the world. "Translators are always willing to embrace the other, to
          venture into new landscapes. . . .
          Translators are eager to get to the next corner where the
          geography of words has changed and new ways of seeing and feeling rise
          at the horizon." This
          way of seeing is everywhere present in Schulte’s latest volume of
          poetry, <i>A Language Without
          Geography</i>. The
          translator’s habit of mind has Schulte restlessly peering around the
          next corner, past fixed ways of seeing, into the mysteries that hide
          beneath the surface of words. "To
          resurrect the poem," the poet tells us on the first page of the
          volume, "I must kill / the comfort of convenience / I must kill /
          myself." More than a declaration of artistic impersonality, the dictum
          warns against relying on habit-personal, cultural, or
          historical-when composing. The
          warning guides the reader of his volume as well, for resurrecting the
          poem is as much a feat of readership, one feels, as authorship.</p><p><i>A Language Without
          Geography</i> is about the space between self and other where language
          becomes the medium of translating the encounter, making meaning from
          it. The recurrent imagery of water, rivers, and oceans often
          suggest the fluid realm of the present moment, where self and other
          meet, where the opportunity to create new forms arises.
          The poem "Maturing" is a good example of the process by
          which the poet arrives at this space.</p><p></p><p>
          One day my words</p><p>
          reversed the river’s stream.</p><p></p><p>
          I exploded within myself</p><p>
          I gave leaves to the tree</p><p>
          I gave words to my lips</p><p>
          I gave hunger to my thoughts</p><p>
          I rose from myself</p><p>
          and stepped into the word</p><p>
          that flowed from my blood.</p><p></p><p>
          The world began</p><p>
          to circle around my words.</p><p></p><p>The poem, particularly the last stanza,
          recalls Wallace Stevens, whose optimistic embrace of the freedoms that
          come with subjectivity shares much with Schulte’s delight in the
          individual’s power of creation and reconfiguration.
          Beginning with the idea that the poet’s very words alter the
          flow of experience, the poem offers a brief myth of creation.
          Here, words do not merely name things already in existence but
          bring them into being. The
          last stanza invites us to recall the world of conventional creation
          myths, but undermines conventional expectations by asserting the power
          of the poet. Importantly for Schulte, the force of the explosion like a
          volcanic eruption which changes the make-up of the land, or an
          earthquake which alters the flow of rivers emanates from the flow of
          blood more than from the mind. That
          is, creation for Schulte begins and remains tied to biological
          impulses, our physical being’s connection with the world.
          Our sensual experience guides the translation process through
          language, helping one make fluid a medium fraught with cliches and
          rigid symbols.</p><p>
          The depiction of "The Slimy Minister" condemns the
          profanity of words used without sensual harmony.
          "Empty in himself" the minister uses "Bible words /
          printed symbols" to drive "into air / nails that bend under the /
          pressure of hammers." The
          assault with sharp, inflexible words contrasts with the effusive image
          of creation in poems like "Maturing."
          Without a fullness of being from which his own vocabulary might
          come, the minister’s precast symbols can only bend as reality
          resists the pressure of his own insistence, resulting in a failed
          communion for his audience. By
          contrast, the poet is more collaborative, aware of flux, as Schulte
          writes in a later poem: "I spoke my language / and with my hands / I imprinted /
          delicate rhythms / on the flow of time."</p><p>
          Schulte also shares with Stevens an affinity for the motif of
          music. The final section
          of the volume, entitled "Interior with Music," begins with the
          lines "Between water and moon / the night kept singing."
          And indeed, the earth is always opening up to Schulte’s
          attentive ear. For him,
          listening is never a passive activity.
          "Listen," he writes,</p><p></p><p>
          when all noises</p><p>
          around you have died.</p><p>
          Listen to the pulse</p><p>
          under your feet</p><p>
          a stone,</p><p>
          a flower,</p><p>
          a tree</p><p>
          a drop of water in an</p><p>
          invisible root. Pour
          yourself into the earth</p><p>
          until its fire</p><p>
          runs through your blood.</p><p></p><p>This passage exemplifies Schulte’s
          collection in its clarity of image, simple syntax, and the perfect
          rhythm of its line breaks, but also in its address of the reader.
          One of many such moments, the poet, motivated by a generous
          enthusiasm rather than a didactic impulse, invites us to listen as he
          narrates the moment of his own discovery.
          Listening with feet-a pun that elides the body’s
          receptivity with poetic feet-the poet becomes the drop of water
          seeping into subterranean realms. The process reveals the way the earth’s music is made
          audible for translation. It
          is a process of feeling, of allowing one’s senses to pick up the
          delicate harmony between our own pulse and the pulses of the world
          beneath our feet, beneath our words.</p><p>
          One of several short meditations interspersed through the
          volume reads, "In books / we look for the life / we have not
          lived." Simple, yet
          suggestive, this epigraph applies to Schulte’s own book.
          Ever the translator, Schulte brings us the life we have not
          lived, the foreign, the strange, what is hidden underneath familiar
          surfaces, and enables us to see and hear its shapes and sounds, its
          new geography.</p></body>
