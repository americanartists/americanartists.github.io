      <h1>The Transforming Eye of Kathleen Alcalá</h1>
      <h3>by Rob Johnson</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>Three years ago I
      began researching a type of story written by Mexican and Mexican-American
      writers called <i>cuentos de fantasmas</i>,
      literally "phantom" or "ghost" stories, but what I would generally
      describe as supernatural stories. </p><p>Before
      long I came across Kathleen Alcalá’s <i>Mrs. Vargas and the
      Dead Naturalist</i> (1992), a story collection she introduces with the
      following thoughts:"These
      stories are about inner landscapes; they explore the invisible world
      behind the visible, and the characters who move in both worlds through the
      windows of dream and imagination. "Her words captured the spirit of my anthology, and I was pleased
      and grateful when she agreed to write the "Introduction" to <i>Fantasmas</i>
      (Bilingual Press, 2000). In
      it, she says, "When I saw the announcement for <i>Fantasmas</i>,
      my first thought was ‘Why haven’t I been asked to contribute to this?After all, my work has been reviewed in <i>The
      New York Review of Science Fiction</i>. How fantastic is that?’ "Alcalá is obviously happy for her work to be known for its element
      of fantasy, a quality that distinguishes her fiction from the social
      realism of the <i>And</i><i>The</i><i>Earth Did Not Devour Them</i>-school
      of decidedly <i>un</i>-fantastic
      Chicano literature. In a
      story by Lucrecia Guerrero in <i>Fantasmas</i>,
      for example, a character <i>is </i>devoured
      by the earth after being cursed by her mother, and that’s the kind of
      occurrence that could also happen in an Alcalá story. </p><p>This does not
      mean that Alcalá ignores social reality in her story collection and three
      novels (the opposite is true); it simply means that there is more than
      meets the eye in her fictional world. In <i>Mrs. Vargas and the Dead
      Naturalist</i>, there are indeed fantastic stories of mermaids singing and
      magical cameras and birds of ill-omen.  "The Transforming Eye" shows a
      young woman impossibly entering the <i>trompe
      l’oeil</i> backdrop in a photo shop:</p><p>Impatient, I stepped back into the portrait area to
      see if the photographer was there. The
      lights were on, and the backdrop glowed enticingly. On the stone bench in the scene was a wooden bowl full of
      deliciously red pomegranates. They
      looked so real that I couldn’t restrain myself from reaching to pick one
      up. The leathery skin and
      prickly end felt as real to me as any fruit I had ever touched. I turned with the pomegranate in my hand and saw that I stood on
      the black and white tiles, the bright trees trailing their branches over
      my head. . . . I was inside
      the backdrop.</p><p>Unbelievable,
      yes, but this expert bit of <i>legerdemain</i>
      is grounded in the reality of the death of the narrator’s grandmother in
      Mexico, and the tears that are cried in the fountain in the
      photographer’s <i>faux</i> backdrop
      rob her of her grief in reality. Here and elsewhere in the collection, thehidden "moral" of the story is reminiscent of the subterranean
      meaning found in the early works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, another writer
      for whom the "middle ground" of romance was native territory. This comparison is not farfetched:The title story of Alcalá’s collection, for example, is a subtle
      allegory of how science seeks to destroy the very object it observes, the
      theme of many of Hawthorne’s tales, such as "Rappacinni’s
      Daughter. "In this respect,
      I have to wonder why Joyce Carol Oates ignored Alcalá in her anthology <i>American
      Gothic Tales</i> (1997), for Alcalá’s works would have complemented the
      stories Oates did select by Hawthorne, Flannery O’Connor, Stephen
      Millhauser, and others. (There
      are no Mexican-American writers in Oates’ "American" collection.)</p><p>In
      the three novels that have followed <i>Mrs.
      Vargas and the Dead Naturalist</i>, you can see Alcalá moving beyond (or
      perhaps deeper into) what Ursula K. LeGuin once called "Alcalá-land"
      and exploring a past that can make us see our present differently-and
      may be evocative as well of a yet unseen future. Alcalá is, in other words, a visionary writer, which puts her in
      the company most closely of Leslie Marmon Silko, whose revelatorynovel <i>Almanac of the Dead</i>
      (1991) is based on Native-American prophecy. In her novels, Alcalá reveals the often hidden identity of the
      people of the Southwest and Northern Mexico, covering territory that no
      American writer before her has traveled. </p><p><i>Spirits
      of the Ordinary</i>(1996) tells the story of one such hidden people. Julio Vargas Caraval, his wife Mariana, and their son Zacarías are
      the descendants ofJews who
      trace their history back to the late sixteenth century, when the
      goverernor of Saltillo, Luis de Carabajal, was roasted alive in a dry
      cauldron for admitting he was a Jew. In his last words, he declared that "were it not for the
      Inquisition, there would be fewer Christians in this kingdom than he could
      count on the fingers of his hand. "The book concludes with another account of religious persecution in
      the late nineteenth century, the slaughter of Indians at Casas Grandes by
      the Mexican military. In its
      dramatization of the role the spirit plays in peoples’ lives, Alcalá’s
      novel moves beyond typical "people’s history. "<i>Spirits of the Ordinary</i>
      is in fact a deeply religious novel, full of marvelous translations from
      Hebrew into Spanish and finally into English. Its history of Mexico’s Jews and of the spiritual beliefs of the
      indígenes are, remarkably, brought together in their common prophecy of a
      "Fourth World. "</p><p>The
      excitement of reading the novel comes from the unexpected variety and
      richness ofthe cultures
      represented in nineteenth-century Mexico. Here, for example, is a beautifully full picture of
      turn-of-the-century Saltillo:</p><p>Horacio put on his coat and hat and let himself out of the shop. 
      The bell clanged behind him as he shut the door firmly. Already the streets were filling with people-cooks buying food
      for the day, firewood vendors, bankers, traveling businessmen. His grandsons would be in school, and their sisters helping their
      mothers with household chores. Early mass was over, and the black-shawled widows cast
      shadows in the early-morning sun. </p><p>Horacio made his way to the narrower streets of the Arab quarter
      and turned in at a shop with the word "Babilonia" written in white
      script over the door. An
      unfortunate name, thought Horacio, in a Christian country. But then, Ahmed would be too stubborn to admit that, since it was
      the city of his birth. </p><p>We sense as we read the novel that this is a
      story that has been in front of us always, just ignored. Elsewhere, Alcalá has described her mission as a writer in this
      way:"I want my writing to
      insinuate itself into the subconscious of the people of the Southwest, so
      that we might remember who we were and who we will be. "Even for those of us who live in the Southwest (such as myself)
      these books are literally eye-opening. </p><p>Alcalá’s
      second novel, <i>The Flower in the
      Skull</i> (1998) is connected to the first with overlapping characters and
      by its uncovering of another "hidden" people. The second novel feels different than the first, though, as it is
      written in an oral style that employs repetition (with variation) and a
      circular plot-line. <i>Flower
      </i>dramatizes the fate of three women who are descendants of the Opata
      Indians of Mexico and America, a people whose culture has nearly been
      erased by a succession of colonial powers. The character Rosa captures this mixture of races in her own search
      for identity:</p><p>It made me wonder what it meant to be related to
      someone, to be part this or part that. I was part Irish, because of my father, and I was part Indian,
      because of my mother. But I
      felt more Mexican than either of them, like the Morenos.  We all spoke
      Spanish and lived in the same part of town and went to school together
      with the other Mexicans. Sometimes
      the children called me india because of my mother, but not very much,
      because some of the Mexican children were much darker than I was, and were
      probably just as india as I was, if not more. </p><p>Throughout
      the book, Alcalá complicates any simple identity politics, questioning as
      she does, for example, the real difference between Mexican-Americans and
      Native-Americans, labels which are starting to make less and less sense. This aspect of her work has the potential to startle American
      audiences complacent in their acceptance of "multiculturalism" by
      literally transforming what we see when we view the people of the
      Southwest and the Border. </p><p>As
      a visionary work, <i>The Flower in the
      Skull</i> succeeds, for me, by revealing its meaning through a series of
      richly symbolic, sometimes startling transformations and magic
      lantern-type effects. Here
      in <i>The Flower in the Skull</i> is
      Alcalá’s description of the lamp shop of Alma Prieta, a <i>curandera</i>
      who is consulted by Concha about the wisdom of marrying Rosa to the
      evangelical minister Gabriel:</p><p>In its front window was a lit kerosene lamp glowing
      through a wide rawhide shade and illuminating a scene that never failed to
      draw me closer as I passed by. On
      it was painted a series of scenes of Indians and white pioneers. . . . [The Indians] had their heads shaved except for a small piece like
      a porcupine, and rode tall horses and lived in pointed houses with poles
      sticking out of the top. . . . The other side of the lampshade showed Anglos bundled up in
      many clothes in horse-drawn wagons. Even
      the wagons were covered up, as though wearing huge bonnets. In each scene, a few men rode ahead of the others on their horses. They appeared to be leading the way. But since all of them were heading in the same direction on the
      shade-to the left-the two parties would never encounter each other. It was the perfect solution to the West-the bravos leading the
      way, followed by the children, the women, and the dogs, then a little
      space followed by the men pioneers, followed by their families. As long as they continued to circle the lampshade, they would
      never run out of frontier. The
      would never run into each other and have to fight. </p><p>Such
      camera obscura moments fill Alcalá’s work and stay with the reader
      afterwards. In the first
      novel, a barren desert becomes transformed for Zacarías into its ancient
      form as an ocean bed, and he momentarily views vast whales sounding the
      desert floor. Photographs are
      a key medium in Alcalá’s questioning of appearance versus reality (as
      in the magical camera of "The Transforming Eye"). In <i>The Flower in the Skull</i>,
      Concha begins the book in first person, telling her story of her life with
      the Opata before they are uprooted. Later,
      we see her through her daughter Rosa’s eyes, and finally in a photograph
      discovered eighty years later by a young researcher in Arizona named
      Shelly. This photograph of an Opata woman living in a culture but
      clearly not being of that culture becomes Shelly’s most valued
      possession-and the writer’s. She
      studies Concha in the curling picture, and imagination and dreams reveal
      the story that lay hidden in old photographs stored in shoe boxes, stories
      that are (mostly) lost. At
      the end of the book, Shelly embarks on a pilgrimage to Magdalena, and
      sitting disoriented and road-weary in a café, she is joined by a waitress
      taking her break. "Tell me
      your story," she says to Shelly. </p><p>Kathleen Alcalá is a storyteller I
      continue to listen to. I live
      in McAllen, Texas, eight miles from the Mexican border at Reynosa, three
      hours by car from Saltillo and other places in Northern Mexico Alcalá
      writes about. I read her work
      for a fundamental reason:she
      opens my eyes and shows me, literally, a new way of seeing who I am, the
      people I live among, and the place where I live. Her forthcoming novel, <i>Treasures
      in Heaven</i>, will complete her trilogy of works on nineteenth-century
      Mexico. The excerpt appended
      below ("Blood and Ceremony") indicates that this novel, too, deals
      with yet another "hidden" people in Mexico-the women who played a
      crucial role in the political events leading up to the 1910 Revolution. Estela and other characters from the first two novels are also
      characters in this third novel. </p></body>
