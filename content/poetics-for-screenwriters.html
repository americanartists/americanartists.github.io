      <h1>Review of Lance Lee, A Poetics for Screenwriters (Austin: U of Texas P, 2001), 145 pp.</h1>
      <h3>by Lia Hotchkiss</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>With
          his concise yet detailed book <i>A
          Poetics for Screenwriters</i>, Lance Lee has written the ideal
          companion volume to any methodologically based manual of Hollywood
          screenwriting. His book offers not a method or an approach to writing
          screenplays, but a structural overview of the basic building blocks
          that comprise classical Hollywood narratives.In addition, as his title suggests, Lee sets screenwriting in
          the context of dramatic literature in general and thus thinks of his
          task as an updating, broadening, and clarification of the dramatic
          principles Aristotle puts forth in his <i>Poetics</i>.Lee’s approach employs order, common sense, accessible
          language, and a plethora of clear examples taken from such films as <i>High
          Noon</i>, <i>Blue</i>, <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>, <i>Jurassic
          Park: The Lost World</i>, <i>Fanny
          and Alexander</i>, <i>Raiders of
          the Lost Ark</i>, <i>On the
          Waterfront</i>, <i>Witness</i>, <i>The Godfather</i>,
          and <i>The Usual Suspects</i>, to
          name just a few.</p><p>Just
          as Aristotle emphasizes the cathartic quality of tragedy, so Lee also
          emphasizes drama’s-and hence narrative film’s-ritual function.In chapter one, he links screenwriting’s plots to coming of
          age rituals that effect simultaneous personal and social
          transformation as a new member joins the adult social order, a basic
          pattern of problem, action, crisis, and transformation that he locates
          in tragedy and comedy alike.More
          generally still, he suggests that dramatic conflict plays out the
          perennial conflict between Dionysian passion and Apollonian control.He links these two ritual functions of transformation and
          balance in the form of the Jungian hero, a metaphor for ego
          integration and our stand-in, who must overcome the conflict between
          the monstrous passions of the unconscious on the one hand and
          life-affirming civilization on the other.Consequently, drama, broadly understood to include film, "is
          an engine of transformation" that confers on its audience "a
          vicarious sense of wholeness" (7).</p><p>This
          initial context of ritual transformation leads Lee to suggest a basic
          plot pattern that undergirds the entire book: after Aristotle, in
          chapters one and two, he posits a beginning, middle and end structure
          in which the beginning lays out the conflict, incorporates
          pre-existing problems into the situation the hero and heroine are
          already trying to solve, and formulates a plan of action; the middle
          attempts to resolve the conflict by implementing that plan of action,
          but ends in a crisis when that plan collapses or appears to do so; and
          the end contains the action taken in response to the crisis as well as
          the climax which resolves the conflict-either through success or
          failure--and renders all known (6-7).This pattern, which Lee illustrates time and again with
          examples, dictates a perennial three-act structure and comprises a
          motif to which the book returns frequently.</p><p>Chapter
          one goes on to give an overview of the history of drama, concluding
          its summary with a discussion of the extent to which classical
          Hollywood narrative is indebted to Naturalism and realism as they
          appear in Ibsen’s writing.There
          follows a complementary section devoted to film’s contributions to
          the dramatic tradition such as its compelling reality effect, the
          intimacy of the camera’s gaze, its ability to render dramatic rhythm
          "viscerally visible" (23), and its tight linking of writing and
          visible behavior.The
          chapter ends with a discussion of the audience, which introduces the
          book’s second recurrent point, namely the importance of audience
          identification.Without
          that identification, Lee argues, the story doesn’t exist and the
          transformative ritual function is not fulfilled.</p><p>Starting
          with both succinct and elaborated definitions of a screenplay in terms
          of its elements and purpose, chapter two turns to the fundamental
          elements of plot.As one
          would hope, Lee’s discussion of the central notion of conflict gives
          concrete advice: conflict, he writes, arises from a problem that must
          be resolved and from a collision of wills.There must always be something at stake and an obstacle to be
          overcome.Above all,
          conflict must be clearly defined, experienced moment to moment, and
          involve the very survival, in one sense or another, of the hero or
          heroine (34-36).The
          chapter in general is a practical one, lying at the heart of the
          book’s project.In it,
          Lee defines terms such as "scene" vs. "sequence" and discusses
          such writerly concerns as how to choose material and treatment;
          establish character and conflict; and construct a backstory,
          preparation for future events, and exposition.He also gives nuance to his beginning, middle, and end plot
          structure by introducing the elements of complications--or dramatic
          problems--major and minor reverses, types of discoveries, and the
          dramatic obstacle.Finally, he breaks the three basic building blocks of
          beginning, middle and end down into their own constituent beginnings,
          middles, and ends, illustrating their recommended structures and
          variations through several examples.</p><p>Chapter three
          explores in more depth the second primary principle of the book after
          structure, that is, audience identification.In it, Lee links his emphasis on emotions to the
          cause-and-effect structure of classical Hollywood narrative.Without a cause-and-effect structure, he claims, character
          behavior will not make sense, thus frustrating audience empathy,
          sympathy, and understanding.Likewise,
          in a discussion highly reminiscent of Aristotle, he argues that in
          order to foster audience identification, every element in a screenplay
          should be necessary and probable.That is not to say, however, that irrational behavior does not
          have a place, for to some extent all screenplays examine irrational
          behavior.It simply
          becomes one of the problems raised in the plot.Avoidable improbabilities, on the other hand--particularly
          those of setting--are an unpardonable lapse, although Lee is practical
          enough to admit that improbabilities of plot or premise will intrude.He recommends only reporting rather than showing such
          improbabilities, for present credulity elicited by the probable
          elements that are shown can cover a multitude of sins.He suggests that Sophocles, for example, does well not to show
          Oedipus, fearful of killing his father, attacking and killing a man
          old enough to be his father, moreover one attended by several of his
          subjects, for the event strains credulity.</p><p>The
          fourth chapter, which returns to concerns of plot, namely plot types
          and genres, is useful for its advice about where to begin a
          screenplay: Lee recommends starting with "the complication that
          requires an unresolved problem from the past to appear progressively
          as a necessary element for the resolution of the protagonist’s
          immediate problem" (75).Eschewing
          the overly restrictive neoclassical imposition of the three unities,
          Lee divides plots broadly into organic and episodic.He favors the former, since organic plots try to observe the
          standard of the necessary and probable and speak to the ritual
          function of drama more effectively.His organic ideal of writing comes through in his advice on the
          use of flashbacks, which he likes for their realism, that is, their
          fidelity to the fluid sense of time our minds experience as we mix
          past and present.Nonetheless,
          such fidelity is not alone sufficient: flashbacks "must be
          immediately motivated in the cause-and-effect flow of the action, and
          all flashbacks must help define the immediate action or move it
          forward" (85).Lest the
          budding screenwriter, however, think that plots can be written to
          formula, Lee concludes the chapter with a discussion of exceptions to
          the general rule of the three-act plot structure that he emphasizes.</p><p>Chapters
          five, six and seven are shorter treatments of the issues of character,
          theme, and spectacle, respectively.Unlike Aristotle, Lee puts equal emphasis on character and plot
          and links both to emotion: character, situation and plot are all made
          real through the emotion of identification.He has an interesting psychologistic explanation of the genesis
          and effect of forcefully drawn characters: a character arises from a
          conflict or drive in the writer; writing distances him or her from
          that conflict, and the strength of feeling behind the character evokes
          a similar response in the audience (89).Such an insight is a reminder that Lee approaches his <i>Poetics</i>
          more as a creative writer than an academician, and the rest of chapter
          five bears that out.It
          consists more or less in a checklist of elements such as consistency,
          vividness, motivation, and an inner life, outer life, and past that
          need to be defined in order to present a fully realized character.Chapter six is Lee’s limited defense of theme--which he calls
          ideas--in Hollywood films, a collective too apt to be dominated by
          what he dismissively refers to as "genre writing," which favors
          thrills at the expense of thought.In this chapter Lee grants structure its ultimate function:
          it is not simply a pattern of organization per se, but a structuring
          principle for our "attending" to the film, "which is to say that
          structure communicates meaning and ends in knowledge" (102).This attending, however, works not through an analytical
          understanding of the structure, but through emotional identification.Unlike film theorists like David Bordwell, Janet Staiger and
          Kristin Thompson whose <i>Classical
          Hollywood Cinema</i> postulates that we watch films interactively by
          constructing hypotheses about what is to happen, Lee feels that our
          ability to predict the action, i.e., become analytically astute
          viewers, is a sign of bad writing.Instead, like the characters, we should be in a "state of
          immediate, desperate ignorance" able to be surprised by the turns of
          plot (103).</p><p>Just
          as theme is subordinated to emotion in chapter six, so is spectacle to
          identification, music to mood, and dialogue to behavior in chapter
          seven.This chapter is
          something of a catchall for the terms not yet discussed such as symbol
          and metaphor, dramatic irony, comedic turns, and adaptation.It returns to Lee’s highly pragmatic approach of chapters two
          through five and contains useful discussions of the qualities of
          dialogue, which should be appropriate to the characters, economical,
          expressive of emotion and sparing of dialect; and of comedy, which
          utilizes techniques such as verbal misconstruction, reductio ad
          absurdum, mistaken identity, dramatic irony, implied reversals, and
          physical comedy.Throughout
          the chapter, he bears in mind a writer’s concerns, such as how to
          approach an adaptation, and pitfalls, such as the underuse of
          contractions, overuse of stage directions, and sheer use of
          speechifying rather than showing characters reacting to one another.The section on comedy is particularly well developed in
          comparison to the others, although Lee admits that a full treatment is
          beyond the scope of the book.</p><p>The
          final chapter gives an overview of how to develop and film
          screenplays.Lee offers
          the reader a wide range of examples for invention and a useful
          checklist of questions pertaining to structure.He defines terms used in the film business such as
          "premise," "treatment," "stepsheet," and "storyboard,"
          and discusses the conventions of design, language, and length used in
          writing and/or drawing them.He
          concludes with a couple of sections that realistically discuss the
          lesser status of the writer in Hollywood relative to the creative
          control a playwright or a film director exerts.Lee has some advice for minimizing that loss of creative
          control, such as working with a director who respects the writer’s
          work and contracting the right to make revisions.In words of careful encouragement, he warns that filmmaking is
          a collaborative business and screenwriting a lonely one necessitating
          great perseverance in writing and persistence in marketing the
          finished screenplay.</p><p>This
          book is perhaps most useful because of a feature that receives short
          shrift in a review such as this one, that is, in its heavy use of
          examples to illustrate all of its points.Lee comes across as an inspired teacher, able to render the
          abstract concrete through explanatory illustrations.The sheer variety of screenplays he draws on (over 140)
          provides convincing evidence for the prevalence of his structural
          analysis of classical Hollywood cinema.Anyone interested in going into screenwriting would be well
          advised to follow his recommendations, for as much as Lee may deplore
          genre films, Hollywood does tend to be formula-driven and a wise
          writer knows both the formula as well as its potential for supple
          variation.For those
          interested in more avant-garde writing, however, the book is less
          useful, for even such classics as <i>Last
          Year at Marienbad</i> are beyond the purview of Lee’s argument.Nonetheless, within its frame of reference, it is an invaluable
          analysis of the purpose, structure, emotional appeal and dynamics of
          the successful Hollywood screenplay useful not only for the student of
          film but the student of drama as well.</p></body>
