      <h1>Emily Reed</h1>
      <h3>by Dan Rogers</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>Friday,
          June 2, 2000</p><p>Emily
          Reed died two weeks ago, and I only heard Monday.</p><p>She rated
          an obituary in the <i>New York Times</i>, and I took notice, since it
          was subtitled "Librarian in ’59 Alabama Racial Dispute." As
          director of the Alabama Public Library Service Division, which lent
          books to libraries throughout the state, Reed chose to allow Garth
          Williams’ <i>The Rabbits’ Wedding</i> onto her shelves. From those
          shelves, the imagination could and did easily see the book pass into
          the hands of children. Most of Alabama’s literate children were, of
          course, white. And the book, which I have never read, features the
          nuptials of a black and a white rabbit.</p><p>A
          political uproar ensued over the perceived allegory of miscegenation.
          After vile questioning from state senators about her beliefs
          concerning integration, Reed left the state, presumably forever. She
          worked in Washington, DC and Baltimore the rest of her life, and died
          in a nursing home in Maryland.</p><p>Finishing
          the obituary, I felt the kind of moral nausea that usually only comes
          from profound personal shame at my own misdeeds. I was most disturbed
          that Reed was chased away from this, my home state, and never
          returned. Her rough interrogation at the hands of coarse, sweaty
          bigots in seersucker was all too easy to picture. In her place, I
          would have left, too.</p><p>But
          fortunately or not, I was not alive yet and forced to confront the
          question of emigration. Four years later, in Birmingham just a few
          months before Martin Luther King wrote his letter from the city jail
          there, I was born into a lower middle-class white family. I remained
          totally unaware of integration’s chaos until my family, which had
          moved to a nearly all-white suburb of Pittsburgh in 1967, moved back
          to Alabama in 1972. I now had black class mates and didn’t know how
          to react around them, but had already figured out that you were
          supposed to react. You couldn’t just be around them, you had to have
          a conscious attitude. I was a white Southerner, all right. Five years
          in northern suburbs had changed nothing.</p><p>That fall
          of 1972, my older brother made a black friend in our rural school and
          asked him to visit our dilapidated farm house. The friend never came.
          He was afraid we would shoot him. If a nine-year-old could laugh in
          scorn, I would have. I knew my family didn’t shoot people. But I
          still didn’t have any idea what my brother’s friend, or Emily
          Reed, or a million black Alabamians, or hundreds of thousands of
          loving white Alabamians had suffered, were suffering, for their
          support of the basic principles of kindness and charity.</p><p>Slowly,
          the poison surrounding me seeped into my system. I only know it now,
          when occasions like Emily Reed’s death force me to reflect on my
          past and the culture that became part of my character. In school, I
          never had black friends and would have thought it odd or uncool if I
          had. In my teens, I could laugh thoughtlessly and then pass on jokes
          told at the expense of blacks. It means nothing to say that I was
          young, didn’t know any better, and appear to have changed for the
          better. The damage is still there, as surely as if I had eaten lead
          paint chips off the school walls.</p><p>Now,
          decades later, I am a historian of modern Germany. I have made the
          study of its reconstruction after World War II the focus of my
          research. Lately, that has meant working through the records of dozens
          of Emily Reed-like incidents, witnessing Germans forced to deal with
          the racism in their past, trying to decide what it means and whether
          it’s still with them. For me, it’s very easy to see the Germans
          avoiding, repressing, twisting, writhing. If a German runs across
          these words, I’m sure she or he will, with a touch of <i>Schadenfreude</i>,
          enjoy seeing me do the same.</p><p>Unlike
          Germany, where it’s illegal to be too overt in one’s support of
          the racist past, we have our die-hard Confederates. Not believing Lee
          surrendered, they fight in his stead over a flag he probably didn’t
          spend too much time worrying about. The flag’s supporters are a poor
          and pathetic remnant of once-formidable public opposition to the idea
          of unity based on respect for diversity. They are a sorry fringe
          element, as the power brokers who used to wage the struggle in public
          now, maybe even mostly unaware, fight in private.</p><p>Around
          here the struggle against unity takes its most insidious form in the
          desertion of the public schools. Most children whose parents can
          afford private schools go there; many of their parents and a vast
          majority of the other whites habitually veto property tax increases
          designed to save the public ones. Without the encouragement of a
          decent school, only the most heroic young blacks will manage to
          overcome centuries of economic history stacked against them. Really,
          who can expect every black child to be such a hero, or condemn those
          who fail to find the necessary courage?</p><p>I imagine
          Emily Reed having grown tired of the struggle, tired of what the
          Germans call the <i>Ewiggestrigen</i>, those incorrigibles who defend
          a past long beyond any defense, who extol one or two extenuating
          circumstances about a society that was and is shot through with the
          worst that humanity has to offer. Like Reed, I may just leave. But, at
          least for a while and maybe forever, I am going to stay here, teach
          about the Germans, and hope my questions about their past don’t make
          me an irredeemable hypocrite.</p><p>Dan
