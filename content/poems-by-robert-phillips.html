      <h1>Spinach Days and Other Poems</h1>
      <h3>by Robert Phillips</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>
		These poems are published with permission of the author. Previously published in various journals, they are also part of his book Spinach Days.</p><poem><title>I Remember, I Remember</title><subtitle>(Poem beginning with two lines by Yehuda Amichai)</subtitle><p>The earth drinks people and their loves<br></br>
like wine, in order to forget.<br></br>
But I drink wine to remember.</p><br></br><p>I remember the day at school I thought<br></br>
I had appendicitis. My father came,<br></br>
supported me on both sides to the car,</p><br></br><p>into the doctor's. For that, when Gabriel<br></br>
blows his horn, may Father be supported <br></br>
on both sides to Heaven.</p><br></br><p>I remember the sensation of first love,<br></br>
like falling down a mine shaft.<br></br>
but shafts are dark, and all around</p><br></br><p>me was light, light, light. Her hair<br></br>
light, and when we locked together<br></br>
we were a dynamo generating light.</p><br></br><p>I remember not knowing what I wanted to do<br></br>
in life. My ambitions scattered like newspapers<br></br>
on lawns of people out of town.</p><br></br><p>until I had the right professor for<br></br>
the right course. Suddenly I was on course<br></br>
for what I'd do until the day I die.</p><br></br><p>I remember the day we were wed. In early <br></br>
morning I walked down Marshall Street,<br></br>
wanted to proclaim to everyone I met,</p><br></br><p>"I'm marrying a woman who makes me laugh,<br></br>
a beautiful woman good as fresh-baked bread,<br></br>
pure as a beach where no one walks."</p><br></br><p>I remember the day our son was born,<br></br>
the longest day and night and day<br></br>
of my life--imagine how long for her!</p><br></br><p>When the nurse brought our son to the window,<br></br>
I was Robinson Crusoe discovering Friday's <br></br>
footprint: stranger, companion, friend.</p><br></br><p>I remember, sometimes more than I care to,<br></br>
the friend I let down unintentionally,<br></br>
the brothers I hurt through simple silence,</p><br></br><p>the mother I didn't call often enough when<br></br>
she was bedridden, weak as water. I even<br></br>
remember a dog who wanted to play. I didn't.</p><br></br><p>I remember the day it was confirmed<br></br>
one of my friends had been telling <br></br>
lies about me for years - -</p><br></br><p>They cost me friends, a coveted job.<br></br>
May his tongue be ripped out<br></br>
and flung to the crows.</p><br></br><p>I collect memories the way some collect coins.<br></br>
The memories fade like constellations at dawn.<br></br>
Until my next glass of wine.<br></br></p></poem><poem><title>Spinach Days</title><p>
The odor of cooking spinach<br></br>
brings them back: summer<br></br>
evenings, the world's richest<br></br>
city, Manhatten before my senior year,</p><br></br><p>when Cadillacs grew tailfins,<br></br>
Buddy Holly and The Crickets alarmed<br></br>
parents, Eisenhower full of wind,<br></br>
Mamie tippling at The Gettysburg Farm.</p><br></br><p>A blue-chip ad agency awarded<br></br>
me an "internship." I was recruited<br></br>
for a world I could not afford.<br></br>
In my one wash-and-wear suit,</p><br></br><p>by day I worked in a skyscraper,<br></br>
aluminum waterfall a lobby construct,<br></br>
rooftop restaurant for highsteppers.<br></br>
I wrote clever copy: HOOVER SUCKS</p><br></br><p>for a vacuum cleaner client,<br></br>
PIMPLES CAN MAKE YOU RICH!<br></br>
to druggists for an astringent.<br></br>
My boss rebuffed my greatest pitch,</p><br></br><p>KISS YOUR PAINFUL HEMORRHOIDS GOODBYE,<br></br>
though called it a good attempt.<br></br>
By night I sweated in my room at the "Y,"<br></br>
non-air-conditioned, ten dollars' weekly rent.</p><br></br><p>The one window overlooked an airshaft,<br></br>
but not a whisper of air shafted there.<br></br>
I hung a repro of a Picasso lithograph<br></br>
to make the cell less austere.</p><br></br><p>Rickety desk pushed tight against the bed,<br></br>
but not so tight as my budget—<br></br>
fifty-two dollars a week divided <br></br>
between rent, food, books, cigarettes—</p><br></br><p>not necessarily in that order.<br></br>
Even then books took precedent:<br></br>
A secondhand Sorrows of Young Werther<br></br>
at The Strand meant total absence</p><br></br><p>of lunch. Dinners I was resigned<br></br>
to the Horn & Hardart Automat.<br></br>
Cheap entrees revolved behind<br></br>
glass doors, or the vegetable platter—</p><br></br><p>any three off the steam table<br></br>
for a total of forty-five cents.<br></br>
I thought spinach would enable<br></br>
me with Popeye's omnipotence.</p><br></br><p>It was mushy, foul, overcooked,<br></br>
the water dark as octopus ink.<br></br>
For the rest, mashed potatoes, crook-<br></br>
neck squashed, or corn. I was delinquent</p><br></br><p>in The Great Food Chain, but content.<br></br>
Near pay day, no money even for spinach,<br></br>
I let myself into my aunt's apartment<br></br>
when she was away, quickly dispatched</p><br></br><p>whatever was in the Frigidaire,<br></br>
hoping she wouldn't miss it, or<br></br>
forgive. Dates were free: Washington Square,<br></br>
The Cloisters, Natural History dinosaurs,</p><br></br><p>Lewisohn Stadium concerts where some wag<br></br>
strung banners, EXIT IN CASE OF BRAHMS.<br></br>
Summer nights strollers could zigzag<br></br>
through Central Park without qualm,</p><br></br><p>or so I thought, amble through Harlem<br></br>
back to the East Side, my date<br></br>
swinging her handbag like a pendulum,<br></br>
past laughing Negroes who'd gravitate</p><br></br><p>to front stoops. (Not for decades will<br></br>
we say Blacks, then Afro-Americans,<br></br>
finally African Americans. Nothing's still,<br></br>
how many changes in a short life span?).</p><br></br><p>Spinach brings it back: long showers<br></br>
at the "Y," simply nothing else to do,<br></br>
Dark Victory billed with Now, Voyager<br></br>
at The Thalia, monkeys at the Bronx Zoo,</p><br></br><p>browsing that smorgasbord for bibliophiles,<br></br>
The Gotham, hoping to catch a rising star.<br></br>
Never did, only fading James T. Farrell<br></br>
imbibing at the The Biltmore Men's Bar.</p><br></br><p>(The Biltmore Mens Bar! Even the name<br></br>
is impossible today. But that was then.<br></br>
All males, all crème de la crème,<br></br>
leaned on the mahogany bar like deizens.)</p><br></br><p>I elevated atop The Empire State,<br></br>
saw nothing but fog on foggy mist,<br></br>
like the White on White immaculate<br></br>
canvas at MoMa, post-Impressionist;</p><br></br><p>hung outside gated Patchen Place<br></br>
waiting for Cummings to cross cobbles,<br></br>
or Djuna Barnes. Neither showed face.<br></br>
The White Horse, where Delmore hobnobbed,</p><br></br><p>I shared a pitcher of martinis (a pitcher!)<br></br>
with two older, hard-drinking pals<br></br>
who were paying. I paid—a spectacular<br></br>
hangover for days left me horizontal.</p><br></br><p>By August the city was a cement inferno.<br></br>
My boss promised to get me away<br></br>
to his family's Nantucket bungalow.<br></br>
He never asked, not even by Labor Day.</p><br></br><p>One young man invited me to The Pines,<br></br>
a place I'd never heard of or been.<br></br>
Co-workers advised I should decline.<br></br>
Instead I swam alone at the "Y," chlorine</p><br></br><p>stinging my eyes. (Stripling-shaped,<br></br>
one-hundred-fifty pounds dripping wet,<br></br>
the fat man inside me hadn't yet escaped.<br></br>
Decades later he scored his upset.)</p><br></br><p>Hive-like corridors buzzed with queens<br></br>
(no one knew the word Gays) cruising<br></br>
in BVDs, one café au lait called Josephine<br></br>
because of his effeminate languishing.</p><br></br><p>Locked in my oppressive room I wrote<br></br>
parents dutifully, on sticky sheets<br></br>
slept intermittently, dreaming anecdotes<br></br>
of fame. I filled notebooks with meters,</p><br></br><p>not ads. Lines spilled like cataracts.<br></br>
On occasion I wonder if I were mislead.<br></br>
But most days I think I would go back.<br></br>
Spinach. Loneliness. The future ahead.<br></br><poem><title>Letter to My Mother</title><p>You helped me pack for that milestone<br></br>
event, first time away from home alone.<br></br>
It didn't matter the summer camp was poor--<br></br>
long on Jesus, short on funds--bordering</p><br></br><p>a tea-colored lake. No matter we could afford<br></br>
only two weeks. To help get there I hoarded<br></br>
months of allowances. I was ten, felt grown,<br></br>
I finally was going somewhere on my own.</p><br></br><p>You folded the ironed tee-shirts and skivvies--<br></br>
you even ironed and creased my dungarees.<br></br>
In Southern drawl: "And of course you'll dress<br></br>
for dinner!" you said, packing with the rest</p><br></br><p>my one blazer, dress shirts, and rep tie.<br></br>
I didn't protest, I was an innocent stander-by.<br></br>
(The suitcase was a new brown Samsonite.<br></br>
Even empty that thing never was light.)</p><br></br><p>First exhilarating day--after softball, archery,<br></br>
diving instruction (which I took to swimmingly)--<br></br>
came rest hour. While others took a shower<br></br>
or wrote postcards home, I dressed for dinner:</p><br></br><p>The white shirt, the pre-tied striped tie,<br></br>
the navy jacket. In process I received a wry<br></br>
glance from my counselor. The dinner bell tolled,<br></br>
I felt every bit the gentlemen as I strolled</p><br></br><p>toward the rustic dining room. I entered,<br></br>
the room exploded with boyish hoots and laughter,<br></br>
pointing at me, the funniest thing they'd seen.<br></br>
They still had on their shorts or jeans.</p><br></br><p>The rest of the two weeks were impossible.<br></br>
Not chosen for any teams, called a fool,<br></br>
Mother, I was miserable through and through.<br></br>
But when I came home I never told you.</p></poem><poem><title>Things</title><dedication>For Diane Wakoski</dedication><p>
No ideas but in things,<br></br>
said Doc Williams.<br></br>
Christ! I must have<br></br>
an awful lot of ideas.<br></br>
God knows I have<br></br>
an awful lot of things.<br></br>
I never have enjoyed<br></br>
the luxury of living<br></br>
with nothing, even<br></br>
next-to-nothing.<br></br>
I never learned<br></br>
the lesson of seeing<br></br>
"isolate in the beauty <br></br>
of separateness"<br></br>
each thing by itself.<br></br>
Unto itself, itself.</p><br></br><p>Jay Gatsby, opening the bureau<br></br>
to display all his shirts…</p><br></br><p>I was planted in a crib<br></br>
of things-- ducks, dolls,<br></br>
rattlers of the non-poisonous<br></br>
variety. Growing up I collected:<br></br>
movie star photos, baseball cards,<br></br>
matchbox cars. Live things, too:<br></br>
My gerbils begat unto the umpteenth<br></br>
generation. College years, things<br></br>
worsened. I hated library books,<br></br>
still do. Worth reading, <br></br>
worth owning, my motto. Bookshelves<br></br>
groaned. Paper napkins? Loathe them.<br></br>
Linen closets groaned. Thoreau<br></br>
would groan had he seen the van<br></br>
big as the Mayflower (and so named)<br></br>
lumbering toward Westchester<br></br>
with all my unworldly possessions.<br></br>
One-hundred-ninety cartons<br></br>
of books alone. No, not alone,<br></br>
together.</p><br></br><p>The Collier Brothers, leaving<br></br>
a houseful of newspapers…</p><br></br><p>At night I prowl the rooms <br></br>
of my house, glass in hand,<br></br>
to survey my things. "I'll weed<br></br>
the library," I say. "Throw away<br></br>
two hundred record albums"?<br></br>
low-fidelity sound.<br></br>
And just yesterday<br></br>
they were the very thing.<br></br>
Christ! I need things to keep<br></br>
all my things in. And this year,<br></br>
things got worse. I inherited<br></br>
(of all things) Great Aunt Eva's<br></br>
amber collection. Every surface<br></br>
gleams--glass amber grapes, <br></br>
amber apples, amber ashtrays<br></br>
shaped like gentleman's top hats.<br></br>
I've had to hire a housekeeper<br></br>
just to dust the damned things.</p><br></br><p>McCullers said, "First learn<br></br>
to love a tree, a rock, a cloud…"</p><br></br><p>I do, I do. I love shoe<br></br>
trees, rock records, Rolls-Royce<br></br>
Silver Clouds. Lord, help me<br></br>
abandon these screens I stand<br></br>
behind. Help me come to believe,<br></br>
No things but in ideas.</p></poem><poem><title>Oysters</title><p>One evening we toasted with whiskey sours<br></br>
below Grand Central, in the Oyster Bar.<br></br>
We sat at the rail, felt the world was ours.</p><br></br><p>We ordered some of every kind there are—<br></br>
the Chincoteague, Box, Cotuit, Wellfleet…<br></br>
You called their looks slimy, just like catarrh.</p><br></br><p>I quoted the poet, sounding effete:<br></br>
"Oh, it was a brave man who first ate one!"<br></br>
Feeling brave, we proceeded to eat.</p><br></br><p>We compared sizes, colors, con-<br></br>
sistencies, all the nuances lovers <br></br>
can extract from moments of pure fun.</p><br></br><p>Some we squirted with lime, some we covered<br></br>
with horseradish or Tabasco. A few,<br></br>
too salty, we sentenced to be smothered</p><br></br><p>in chilled cocktail sauce. With great ado<br></br>
that night I showed you—the novice—the way<br></br>
to act Mrs. Waters. You took my cue,</p><br></br><p>raised an oyster high overhead, in play<br></br>
opened your mouth wide as the gates of hell<br></br>
and sucked all the mollusk's juices away.</p><br></br><p>Darling, you learned that lesson much too well.<br></br>
You took my copious feast, dumped the shell.</p></poem><poem><title>Never Date Yourself</title><subtitle>(-Remark by Rob House)</subtitle><p>Why not? It increases your chances for a date<br></br>
on Saturday nights. I'd called every unfortunate </p><br></br><p>in town, been shot down. So finally I telephoned<br></br>
myself on my own phone mail, left a high-toned</p><br></br><p>message: I'd be picking myself up at eight-fifteen.<br></br>
Took a long shower, struggled into Calvin Klein jeans.</p><br></br><p>Next Ralph Lauren sport coat, Gucci loafers, no sox.<br></br>
Reeking of Chanel for Men, I felt quite cocksure.</p><br></br><p>I dropped the Corvette top, drove us to Cinema II.<br></br>
Ironically, a double-feature, both Gerard Depardieu.</p><br></br><p>Bought us a popcorn dripping with extra butter,<br></br>
we dived in with both hands, busy as a knitter.</p><br></br><p>In the dark my left hand held my right,<br></br>
one thigh touched the other, just slightly.</p><br></br><p>Between features I had to go to the john.<br></br>
In the aisle I glanced back, me seated alone.</p><br></br><p>After the show, paused for a smoke in the lot.<br></br>
Myself lit my cigarette. It was almost erotic.</p><br></br><p>Then a fern bar filled with Yuppie scum.<br></br>
We drank double Dewars, Tweedledee, Tweedledum,</p><br></br><p>resisted urges to pilot us to the dance<br></br>
floor. Others doubtless would look askance.</p><br></br><p>Back home I slowly undressed, just one kiss<br></br>
on the mouth in the bedroom mirror, dismissed</p><br></br><p>making love to myself in the looking-glass.<br></br>
(I'm no that kind of guy—I've got more class,</p><br></br><p>it was only our first date, there's time.)<br></br>
Next day I leave myself a message: "I'm </p><br></br><p>glad we went out. I had a ball.<br></br>
In this Postmodern Age, everyone dates it all."</p></poem></p></poem></body>
