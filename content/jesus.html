      <h1>Jesus</h1>
      <h3>by John Sledge</h3>
    </div>

           <body><p>"Even
          now, as we cross to the beginning of the third millennium since his
          birth, we count our days by his appearance on earth."
          So writes Thomas Cahill of Jesus Christ in a new book,
          <book><title>Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After
          Jesus</title><publisher></publisher></book> ($24.95), the latest volume in "The Hinges of
          History" series. Cahill’s two previous volumes in the set, <book><title>How the Irish
          Saved Civilization</title></book> (1995) and <book><title>The Gifts of the Jews</title></book> (1998)
          were both widely acclaimed. Cahill’s
          stated purpose of this series is to explore the "essential
          moments" in Western history, "when everything was at stake."</p><p></p><p>There
          are more books about Jesus Christ than any other historical figure.
          Though no one has done an exact count, the total approaches
          half a million titles. Why
          add another to the pile? Cahill
          makes no apologies for his effort. Indeed, since he means to "retell the story of the Western
          world as the story of the great gift-givers" he can hardly avoid the
          figure of Jesus. Happily,
          Cahill is a talented wordsmith and  <book><title>Desire of the Everlasting Hills</title></book> is a welcome contribution to the literature.</p><p></p><p>The
          book begins with a broad introduction to the ancient Greco-Roman world
          into which Jesus was born and continues with an overview of his life
          and mission. Cahill
          reminds us just how radical Jesus’ methods were:
          He treated women as equals, stressed forgiveness rather than
          blame or revenge and instructed his followers to give all they had to
          the poor. "There is
          nothing like his modus operandi in any other literature of the ancient
          world," Cahill observes. "Jesus
          does not speak of destruction or enslavement," he continues.
          "Instead of lashing out with threats, he holds up an
          ideal-or rather ideals, which are all humbly concrete."</p><p></p><p>Cahill
          writes from a historical perspective but as a believer.
          His style is immediate and direct, though sometimes too
          informal for my taste. For
          example, when listing some of Jesus’ teachings Cahill declares,
          "And don’t look on a woman with lust?
          Earth to Jesus: Hello!"
          There are many such conversational asides, which, in my
          opinion, dilute the text and rob it of some emotional force.</p><p></p><p>"Desire
          of the Everlasting Hills" also features studies of Luke, John and
          the Apostle Paul. According
          to Cahill, Luke "sees Jesus as the bearer of glad tidings to the
          poor, the healer, the liberator" whereas "John’s Jesus is the
          gravitas-encrusted Christ of the ancient creeds, of tasteless
          religious art, of German passion plays and Hollywood movies."
          Paul comes in for some long overdue rehabilitation.
          Cahill labels him "the New Testament’s ultimate democrat"
          and decries the currently reigning perception to the contrary as a
          "pathetic irony."</p><p></p><p>The
          earliest Christians, the people of the Way, are also featured and come
          across as a close-knit faith community surrounded by enemies.
          Even so, Cahill writes, it is "hard to escape the impression
          that in their day they lived buoyantly."
          Cahill beautifully places the Book of Revelation in the context
          of this early Christian world, and shows that its meaning in any other
          sense is specious. "To
          take the many delicate strands of this skillfully woven tapestry and
          reduce them to some literalist fantasy about the present or
          future…is only to demonstrate once again the connection between
          fanaticism and simple-mindedness," Cahill writes.</p><p></p><p>The
          Shroud of Turin also features in this book.
          Though carbon dating in 1991 indicated that the cloth was a
          clever medieval forgery, subsequent thinking and theory once again
          place it in the first century. No
          one disputes that the image is, in effect, a photograph, the result of
          a flash of light which imprinted the picture on the cloth but did not
          burn or scorch it. There
          is, at present, no scientific understanding or consensus about how
          this extraordinary image came to be.
          Cahill uses the Shroud to recall Jesus’ suffering, and opines
          that his awful physical and emotional travail "is surely his
          ultimate gift, for it is his final act of sympathy with us."</p><p></p><p>If
          at times a bit unfocused and wayward,  <book><title>Desire of the Everlasting Hills</title></book> is nevertheless a good introduction to the most compelling
          figure in our culture.</p></body>
